the Lord appears according-to a dream to Joseph in
Egypt, <sup>2:20</sup> saying, [After] you [have] raised yourself [up],
take the [young] child and his mother, and travel into
the land of Israel, for* the ones seeking the [young]
child’s life have died. <sup>2:21</sup> Now he raised himself [up]
and took the [young] child and his mother and came
into the land of Israel. <sup>2:22</sup> But [after] he heard that
Archelaus is reigning over Judea instead of his father
Herod, he was afraid to go there, and having been
divinely-warned according-to a dream, he departed
into the parts of Galilee, <sup>2:23</sup> and he came [and] dwelt
in a city called* Nazareth; *that what was spoken
through the prophets might be fulfilled, that he will
be called a Nazarene.

{Mar 1:1-8 & Mat 3:1-12 & Luk 3:1-18. Judea near Jordan
River 25 or 26 AD.}
<sup>3:1</sup> Now in those days John the Immerser* comes*,
preaching in the wilderness of Judea, <sup>3:2</sup> and saying,
Repent°; for* the kingdom of the heavens has drawn
near. <sup>3:3</sup> For* this one is he who was spoken of by
Isaiah the prophet, saying, “A voice [is] crying in the
wilderness, prepare° the way of the Lord, make<sup>*&#176;</sup> his
paths straight.’  <sup>3:4</sup> Now John himself had his
[outer] clothing [made] from camel’s hair and a leather
belt around his loin, and his nourishment was locusts
and wild honey. <sup>3:5</sup> Then Jerusalem and everyone [in]
Judea and everyone [from] the region around the
Jordan were traveling out to him. <sup>3:6</sup> And they were
being immersed* by him in the Jordan, confessing
their sins. <sup>3:7</sup> But [after] he saw many of the Pharisees
and Sadducees coming upon his immersion*, he said
to them, Offsprings of vipers, who warned you° to
flee from the future wrath? <sup>3:8</sup> Therefore produce°
fruit worthy of repentance. <sup>3:9</sup> And do° not think to
say among yourselves, We have Abraham [for] father;
for* I say to you°, that God is able to lift up children
out-of these stones for Abraham. <sup>3:10</sup> But even
already, the ax is laid to the root of the trees.
Therefore every tree which is not producing good
fruit is cut off and cast into the fire.<sup></sup>
<sup>3:11</sup> I indeed immerse* you° in water toward
repentance, but he who is coming after me is
mightier [than] I, whose shoes I am not sufficient to
bear. He will immerse* you° in [the] Holy Spirit; <sup>3:12</sup>
whose winnowing fan [is] in his hand, and he will be
thoroughly cleansing his threshing floor, and he will
be gathering his grain into the barn, but the chaff he
will be burning up with unquenchable fire.

{Mar 1:9-11, Mat 3:13-17, Luk 3:21-22, Joh 1:29-34?
Jordan east of Jericho, Spring 27 AD.}
<sup>3:13</sup> Then Jesus comes* from Galilee to John, to be
immersed* by him in the Jordan. <sup>3:14</sup> But John was
preventing him, saying, I have need to be immersed*
by you and you are coming to me?
<sup>3:15</sup> But Jesus answered [and ]said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Allow [it]
now; for* thus it is suitable for us to fulfill every
righteousness. Then he allows him.
<sup>3:16</sup> And Jesus, [after] he was immersed*, came-up
immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens
were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God
descending like a dove, and coming upon him; <sup>3:17</sup>
and behold, a voice [came] out-of the heavens, saying,
<span style="font-weight: bold">This is my beloved Son, in whom I am delighted.

[Matthew 4] <a id="Mt4"></a>


<sup>4:1</sup> Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the
wilderness to be tempted by the devil. <sup>4:2</sup> And having
fasted forty days and forty nights, later he hungered.
<sup>4:3</sup> And the Tempter came near [and] said to him, If you
are the Son of God, speak, in-order-that these stones
may become bread.
<sup>4:4</sup> But he answered [and ]said, <span style="font-weight: bold">It has been written,
“Man will not be living upon bread alone, but
upon every declaration traveling through the
mouth of God!’ 
<sup>4:5</sup> Then the devil takes him into the holy city. And
he stands him upon the pinnacle of the temple, <sup>4:6</sup> and
says to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself
downward; for* it has been written that, “He will be
commanding the messengers concerning you, and
they will be lifting you up upon [their] hands, lest you
hit your foot to 
<sup>4:7</sup> Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Again it has been written,
“Do not test the Lord, your God.’ 
<sup>4:8</sup> Again, the devil takes him to an exceedingly
high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of
the world, and the glory of them; <sup>4:9</sup> and he says to
him, I will be giving you all these things, if you
worship me, [when] you [have] fallen short.
<sup>4:10</sup> Then Jesus says to him,<span style="font-weight: bold"> Proceed<span style="font-weight: bold"> behind me,
Adversary! For* it has been written, “You will
worship the Lord your God and you will give-divine service to him only.’  <sup>4:11</sup> Then the
devil leaves him, and behold, messengers came and
were serving him.

{Mar 1:14a & Mat 4:12 & Luk 3:19-20 & Joh 4:1-4 Judea
to Galilee.}
<sup>4:12</sup> Now Jesus, having heard that John was given
up, departed into Galilee.

<sup>4:13</sup> And having left Nazareth, he came [and] dwelt
at Capernaum, the [area] by the sea, in the borders of
Zebulun and Naphtali; <sup>4:14</sup> in-order-that what was
spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled,
saying, <sup>4:15</sup> “The land of Zebulun and the land of
Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond-that of the
Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, <sup>4:16</sup> the people who sit
in darkness saw a great light and to the ones who sit
in the region and shadow of death, light rose [up] for
them.’ 


<sup>4:17</sup> From then [onward], Jesus began to preach and
to say, <span style="font-weight: bold">Repent°<span style="font-weight: bold">; for* the kingdom of the heavens
has drawn near.

{Mar 1:16-20 & Mat 4:18-22 & Luk 5:1-11 Sea of Galilee
near Capernaum.}
<sup>4:18</sup> Now walking beside the sea of Galilee, he saw
two brethren, Simon who is called* Peter and
Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for*
they were fishermen. <sup>4:19</sup> And he says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Come-here°<span style="font-weight: bold"> after me and I will make* you° fishermen of
men. <sup>4:20</sup> Now immediately, they left the nets and
followed him. <sup>4:21</sup> And having advanced from there,
he saw two other brothers, James, the [son] of Zebedee
and John, his brother, in the ship with Zebedee, their
father, mending their nets. And he called them. <sup>4:22</sup>
Now immediately they followed him having left the
ship and their father.

{Mar 1:35-39 & Mat 4:23-25 & Luk 4:42-44 Preaching
through Galilee.}
<sup>4:23</sup> And Jesus was proceeding around the whole [of]
Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching
the good-news of the kingdom and healing every
disease and every illness among the people. <sup>4:24</sup> And
the report of him went forth into the whole [of] Syria
and they brought to him all the ill[ness], holding
various diseases and being held with torments and
being demon-possessed and being epileptic and
paralytics, and he healed them. <sup>4:25</sup> And large crowds
followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and
Jerusalem and Judea and beyond-that of the Jordan.

[Matthew 5] <a id="Mt5"></a>


<sup>5:1</sup> Now having seen the crowds, he went-up into
the mountain. And [after] he himself sat down, his
disciples came to him.

<sup>5:2</sup> And he opened his mouth [and] was teaching
them, saying: <sup>5:3</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The poor in spirit [are] fortunate,
because theirs is the kingdom of the heavens. <sup>5:4</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The ones who are mourning [are] fortunate,
because they themselves will be comforted. <sup>5:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The
meek [are] fortunate, because they themselves will
inherit the earth. <sup>5:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The ones who hunger and are
thirsty [for] righteousness [are] fortunate, because
they themselves will be fully-fed. <sup>5:7</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The merciful
[are] fortunate, because they themselves will be
shown-mercy. <sup>5:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The clean in heart [are] fortunate,
because they themselves will be seeing God. <sup>5:9</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The
peacemakers [are] fortunate, because they
themselves will be called sons of God. <sup>5:10</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The ones
who have been persecuted because of
righteousness are fortunate, because theirs is the
kingdom of the heavens. <sup>5:11</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You° are fortunate
whenever they reproach and persecute you° and
say every evil word against you°, lying, because of
me. <sup>5:12</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Rejoice°<span style="font-weight: bold"> and be° glad, because your°
reward [is] much in the heavens; for* thus, they
persecuted the prophets who [were] before you°.

<sup>5:13</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You° are the salt of the earth, but if the salt
is flavorless, [then] with*<span style="font-weight: bold"> what will it be salted? It is
still not strong-enough [to be used] *for anything,
except to be cast outside and to be trampled down
by men. <sup>5:14</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You° are the light of the world. A city
laying upon a mountain is not able to be hidden.
<sup>5:15</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Nor are they burning a lamp and placing it
under a peck-container, but upon the lamp-stand,
and it is shining to all who are in the house. <sup>5:16</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">So
let your° light shine before men, *that they may see
your° good works and may glorify your° Father,
the [one ]in the heavens.

<sup>5:17</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Do°<span style="font-weight: bold"> not suppose that I came to tear-down
the law or the prophets. I came, not to tear-down,
but to fulfill. <sup>5:18</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For*<span style="font-weight: bold"> assuredly I am saying to
you°, Until heaven and earth would pass away,
one iota or one serif should never pass away from
the law, until all things would become [fulfilled].
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>5:19</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, whoever should loosen one of
these least commandments and should teach men
[to do] so, will be called least in the kingdom of the
heavens, but if he should practice and should
teach [them], this one will be called great in the
kingdom of the heavens. <sup>5:20</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* I am saying to
you°, that if your° righteousness does not abound
more-than [that] of the scribes and Pharisees, you°
should never enter into the kingdom of the
heavens.

<sup>5:21</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You° [have] heard<span style="font-weight: bold"> that it was said to the
ancients, “Do not murder,' but “Whoever should
murder, he will be liable to the judgment.’ {Exo
20:13 & Deu 5:17} <sup>5:22</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But I am saying to you°, that
everyone who is vainly angry<span style="font-weight: bold"> to[ward] his brother
will be liable to the judgment, and if he should say
to his brother, Empty-head, will be liable to the
council, but whoever says, <span style="font-weight: bold">Fool, will be liable to
the hell <span style="font-weight: bold">of fire.

{Vainly can be: with emptiness (without cause or reason; i.e. to
further one's own vanity)}
{The words here in Mat 5:22 don't matter, but the way in
which they are expressed or meant. Empty-head is an expression
of contempt. The Greek here could be simply “fool’ said as an
expression of condemnation or could be a transliteration of
“Moreh’ which is a Hebrew expression of condemnation.}

<sup>5:23</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, if you should be offering your
gift at the altar, and [while you are] there, you
should remember that your brother has
something against you, <sup>5:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">leave your gift there
before the altar and proceed away. First be
reconciled to your brother and then [when] you
[have] come [back], offer your gift. <sup>5:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Be agreeable
with your opponent quickly, until which [time] you
are with him on the road; lest the opponent
should give you to the judge and the judge should
give you to the attendant and you will be cast into
prison. <sup>5:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I am saying to you, You
should never come forth from there, until you
should repay the last copper-coin.

<sup>5:27</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You° [have] heard<span style="font-weight: bold"> that it was said, “Do not
commit adultery.’  <sup>5:28</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But I
am saying to you°, that everyone who is looking [at]
a woman <span style="font-weight: bold"> in order to lust-after her
already committed adultery with her in his heart.
<sup>5:29</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now if your right eye is offending you, pluck [it]
out and cast [it] from you; for* it is advantageous
for you, that* one of your members should perish
and not [that* ]your whole body should be cast into
hell. <sup>5:30</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And if your right hand is offending you,
cut it off and cast [it] away from you; for* it is
advantageous for you, that* one of your members
should perish and not [that* ]your whole body
should be cast into hell.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>5:31</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now it was said that, “Whoever divorces his
wife, let him give her a [document of] divorcement.’
 <sup>5:32</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But I am saying to you°, that
whoever divorces his wife, except-for [the] reason of
fornication, is making*<span style="font-weight: bold"> her commit adultery and
whoever marries [her] who has been divorced is
committing adultery. 
{Once betrothed, once the couple
leave the parents house, (Mat 1:19), with or without all the
pomp and ceremony, they were married. 
We have a “separation’ and “a legal separation’ in English,
the Jews had no such thing, nor did most of the world before the
20<sup>th</sup> century.  The Jews only had divorce (release, disband,
dismiss). 'Put away' was a kindness to mean divorce, similar to
our 'he passed on' vs. 'he is dead'. Once you separated, or moved
out or were put out, you were divorced.}
<sup>5:33</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, you° [have] heard<span style="font-weight: bold"> that it was said to
the ancients, “You will not perjure yourself, but
will be giving your oaths to the Lord.’ {Lev 19:12,
Num 30:2, Deu 23:21} <sup>5:34</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But I am saying to you°,
Literally not to swear; neither in the heaven,
because it is the throne of God; <sup>5:35</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">nor in the
earth, because it is the footstool of his feet; nor
toward Jerusalem, because it is the city of the
Great King, <sup>5:36</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">nor should you swear in your
head, because you are not able to make*<span style="font-weight: bold"> one hair
white or black. <sup>5:37</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But let your° word be, a Yes,
yes; a No, no; and the thing which is more-than
these, is from the evil [one].

<sup>5:38</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You° [have] heard<span style="font-weight: bold"> that it was said, An eye in
exchange-for an eye and a tooth in exchange-for
a tooth.  <sup>5:39</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But I am
saying to you°, Not to stand against an evil [man],
but who[ever] will slap you upon the right jaw, turn
also <span style="font-weight: bold">the other to him. <sup>5:40</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And to the one willing to
have a lawsuit with you and [wants] to take your
tunic, [then] also allow for him [to take your][°][<span style="font-weight: bold"> outer
]<span style="font-weight: bold">garment. <sup>5:41</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And [the one] who will compel you [to
go] one mile, proceed with him two. <sup>5:42</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Give to the
one who asks you and do not turn away from the
one who wishes to borrow from you.

<sup>5:43</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You° [have] heard<span style="font-weight: bold"> that it was said, “You will
love* your neighbor' and hate your enemy. {Lev
19:18} <sup>5:44</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But I am saying to you°, Love<sup>*&#176;</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> your°
enemies, speak° well of the ones who curse you°,
do*&#176; good [things] to the ones who hate you° and
pray° on behalf of the ones railing at you° and [the
ones] persecuting you°. <sup>5:45</sup> [<span style="font-weight: bold">Do this]<span style="font-weight: bold"> *that you° may
become sons of your° Father [who is] in the heavens,
because his sun rises upon the evil and the good
and [it] rains upon the righteous and the
unrighteous. <sup>5:46</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* if you° love* the ones who
love* you°, what reward do you° have? Do not even
the tax collectors do*<span style="font-weight: bold"> the same? <sup>5:47</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And if you°
only greet your° friends, what are you° doing* 
more-than [others]? Are not even the tax collectors
doing*  so? <sup>5:48</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore you° will be complete,
just-like your° Father is complete<span style="font-weight: bold">, the [one] in the
heavens.

[Matthew 6] <a id="Mt6"></a>


<sup>6:1</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Take-heed°<span style="font-weight: bold"> not to do* your° charity before
men, in order to be seen by them, but otherwise
you° have no reward from your° Father, the [one ]in
the heavens.
<sup>6:2</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, whenever you are doing*  charity,
do not sound [a trumpet] before you just-like the
hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the lanes,
*that they may be glorified by men. <span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I
am saying to you°, They are fully having their
reward. <sup>6:3</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But [when] doing*  charity, do not let

<sup>6:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And whenever you pray, do not be just-like

*that they may appear [devout] to men.<span style="font-weight: bold"> Assuredly I

{The example prayer. The Lord's prayer is for unity in John

<sup>6:9</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore you°<span style="font-weight: bold">, pray°<span style="font-weight: bold"> thus: our Father, the

<sup>7:1</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Do<span style="font-weight: bold">° not judge, in-order-that you° might not

you° will be judged and in what measure you°

are you looking at the speck, the one in your
brother’s eye, but do not consider the beam in
your [own] eye? <sup>7:4</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Or how will you say to your
brother, Allow [me, that] I may cast forth the speck
away from your eye, and behold, the beam in your
[own] eye? <sup>7:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You hypocrite, first cast forth the
beam out-of your [own] eye, and then you will see
precisely to cast forth the speck away from your
brother’s eye.

<sup>7:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Do°<span style="font-weight: bold"> not give the holy thing[s] to the dogs, nor

for a loaf he will not give him a stone, will he? <sup>7:10</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">And if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a
serpent, will he? <sup>7:11</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore if you°, being evil,
know to give good presents to your° children,
how-much more will your° Father, the [one ]in the
heavens, be giving good things to the ones who are
asking him?


<sup>7:12</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, all things, as many as you° would
wish that* men should do* for you°, so do<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>*&#176;</sup> also to
them; for* this is the law and the prophets.


<sup>7:13</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Enter<span style="font-weight: bold">° in through the narrow gate, because
wide [is] the gate and broad [is] the way, the one
leading to destruction and many [people] are the

Narrow [is] the gate and pressed [is] the way, the one
leading to life and few are the ones [who are]
finding it.


<sup>7:15</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But take-heed<span style="font-weight: bold">°, [stay] away from false*
prophets, who are coming to you° in sheep’s

will fully know them from their fruits. They do
not collect a grape-cluster from thorns or figs
from thistles, do they? <sup>7:17</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Thus every good tree
produces good fruits, but the rotten tree produces
evil fruits. <sup>7:18</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">A good tree is not able to produce
evil fruits, nor [is] a rotten tree [able] to produce
good fruits. <sup>7:19</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Every tree [which is] not producing
good fruit is cut off and cast into the fire. <sup>7:20</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Consequently*, you° will fully know them from
their fruits. <sup>7:21</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Not everyone who says to me,
Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the
heavens, but the one practicing the will of my
Father, the [one] in [the] heavens. <sup>7:22</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Many will be
saying to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not:
prophesy in your name, and cast forth demons in
your name,<span style="font-weight: bold"> and practiced many miracles in your
name? <sup>7:23</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And then I will confess to them, I never
knew you°. Depart<span style="font-weight: bold">° from me, the one working the
lawlessness.

<sup>7:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, everyone who hears these words
from me and practices them, he will be similar to
a prudent man, who built his house upon the
rock; <sup>7:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and the rain descended and the rivers
came [up] and the winds blew and fell before that
house, and it did not fall; for* it had been founded
upon the rock.  <sup>7:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And everyone hearing these
words from me and [who is] not doing*  them, will
be similar to a foolish man, who built his house
upon the sand; <sup>7:27</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and the rain descended and the
rivers came [up] and the winds blew and hit that
house and it fell and great was its fall.

<sup>7:28</sup> And it happened, when Jesus completed these
words, the crowds were being astounded upon [the
basis of] his teaching; <sup>7:29</sup> for* he was teaching them
like [one] having authority and not like the scribes.

[Matthew 8] <a id="Mt8"></a>


<sup>8:1</sup> Now he himself came-down from the mountain;
large crowds followed him.


<sup>8:2</sup> And behold, a leper came, [and] was worshiping
him, saying, Lord, if you should will [it], you are able
to cleanse me.
<sup>8:3</sup> And Jesus, having stretched out his hand,
touched him, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">I am willing; be cleansed. And
immediately his leprosy was cleansed. <sup>8:4</sup> And Jesus
says to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">See [that] you should speak to no one,
but proceed [on], show yourself to the priest and
offer the gift which Moses commanded, *for a
testimony to them. 


<sup>8:5</sup> Now [after] he  entered into
Capernaum, a centurion came to him, pleading with
him, <sup>8:6</sup> and saying, Lord, my young-servant, a
paralytic, has been put in the house, terribly
tormented.
<sup>8:7</sup> And Jesus says to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">I will heal him, [after] I
have gone [there].
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>8:8</sup> And the centurion answered [and] said, Lord, I
am not sufficient that* you should enter under my
roof, but only speak by word and my young-servant
will be healed. <sup>8:9</sup> For* I am a man also under
authority, having soldiers under myself and I say to
this one, Travel [on] and he is travels [on], and to
another, Come and he comes, and to my bondservant,
Do* this and he does* [it].
<sup>8:10</sup> Now [after] Jesus heard it, he marveled and said
to the ones [who are] following,<span style="font-weight: bold"> <span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I am
saying to you°, Not even in Israel, [have] I found so-great a faith.  <sup>8:11</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But
I am saying to you°, that many will be coming
from the east and the west, and will be reclined
with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the
kingdom of the heavens; <sup>8:12</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">but the sons of the
kingdom will be cast forth into the outer
darkness; the weeping and the gnashing of teeth
will be there. <sup>8:13</sup> And Jesus said to the centurion,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Proceed [on], and as you [have] believed, let it
happen for you. And his young-servant was healed
in that hour.


<sup>8:14</sup> And [after] Jesus came into Peter’s house, he
saw [that] his mother-in-law had been put [in bed] and
fevered. <sup>8:15</sup> And he touched her hand and the fever
left her, and she arose and was serving him. <sup>8:16</sup> Now
[after] it became evening, they brought to him many
demon-possessed and he cast forth the spirits with a
word and healed all who holding an ill[ness]; <sup>8:17</sup> *that
what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be
fulfilled, saying, “He himself took our weaknesses
and bore the diseases [we had].’ 

{Mar 4:35-41 & Mat:8:18-27 & Luk 8:22-25 Sea of
Galilee.}
<sup>8:18</sup> Now [after] Jesus saw large crowds around him,
he commanded [them] to go away beyond-that [area]. <sup>8:19</sup>
And one scribe came near to him,[ and] said, Teacher,
I will be following you wherever you go.
<sup>8:20</sup> And Jesus says to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">The foxes have
burrows and the birds of the heaven [have] nests,
but the Son of Man has nowhere he may bow his
head.
<sup>8:21</sup> Now a different [one] of his disciples said to
him, Lord, permit<span style="font-weight: bold">* me first to go away and bury my
father.
<sup>8:22</sup> But Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Follow me, and leave
the dead to bury their [own ]dead.

<sup>8:23</sup> And having stepped into the ship, his disciples
followed him. <sup>8:24</sup> And behold, a great squall
happened in the sea, so-as [for] the ship to be hidden
by the waves, but he was sleeping. <sup>8:25</sup> And the
disciples having gone [to him], awakened him, saying,
Save us Lord! We are perishing!
<sup>8:26</sup> And he says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why are you°
cowardly? Small faith [ones]! Then he raised himself
up [and] rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great
calm happened.
<sup>8:27</sup> Now the men marveled, saying, What sort of
[man] is this, that even the winds and the sea are
obeying* him?


<sup>8:28</sup> And he himself came to the [area] beyond-that
into the region of the Gergesenes, two demon-possessed [men] met him, coming forth out-of the
tombs, exceedingly fierce, so-then not anyone [was
able] to prevail [or] to pass through that way. <sup>8:29</sup> And
behold, they cried out, saying, What [is this thing] with
us and with you, Jesus, Son of God? Did you come
here to torment us before the time? <sup>8:30</sup> Now a herd of
many swine was being fed from afar, away from
them. <sup>8:31</sup> And the demons were pleading with him,
saying, If you cast us forth, permit<span style="font-weight: bold">* us to go away
into the herd of swine.
<sup>8:32</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Proceed<span style="font-weight: bold">° away! Now
they came forth and went into the herd of swine and
behold, all the herd of swine rushed down the cliff
into the sea and died in the waters. <sup>8:33</sup> Now the ones
who are feeding [them] fled and went away into the
city [and] reported all things and [even] the things of the
ones being demon-possessed. <sup>8:34</sup> And behold, all the
city came forth *for a meeting with Jesus and [after][
]they saw him, they pleaded [with him] *that he should
go-away from their borders.

[Matthew 9] <a id="Mt9"></a>

<sup>9:1</sup> And he stepped into the ship [and] ferried over
and came into [his] own city.


<sup>9:2</sup> And behold, they were bringing a paralytic to
him, having been put upon a cot, and Jesus saw their
faith said to the paralytic, <span style="font-weight: bold">Child, have courage;
your sins have been forgiven to you.
<sup>9:3</sup> And behold, some of the scribes said among
themselves, This one is blaspheming.
<sup>9:4</sup> And Jesus, having seen their contemplations
said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why are you° contemplating evil in your°
hearts? <sup>9:5</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  For* what is easier, to say, Your sins
have been forgiven; or to say, Lift yourself up and
walk? <sup>9:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But in-order-that you° may know that
the Son of Man has authority upon the earth to
forgive sins (then he says to the paralytic), <span style="font-weight: bold">[After]<span style="font-weight: bold"> you
[have] raised yourself [up], lift up your cot and
proceed away to your house. <sup>9:7</sup> And having raised
himself [up], he went away to his house. <sup>9:8</sup> Now [after]
the crowds saw [it], they marveled and glorified God,
who gave such authority to men.

{Mar 2:13-14 & Mat 9:9 & Luk 5:27-28 At or near
Capernaum.}
<sup>9:9</sup> And passing by from there, Jesus saw a man,
called* Matthew, sitting at a tax-office and he says to
him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Follow me. And having stood up, he followed
him.


<sup>9:10</sup> And it happened, [while he was] reclining [at a
meal] in the house, behold, many tax collectors and
sinners came and reclined together-with Jesus and his
disciples. <sup>9:11</sup> And [after] the Pharisees saw it, they said
to his disciples, Why is your° teacher eating with the
tax collectors and sinners?
<sup>9:12</sup> But Jesus having heard it, said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">The
ones who are strong have no need of a physician,
but the ones who have an ill[ness]. <sup>9:13</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now [when]<span style="font-weight: bold">
traveling [on], learn° what is [meant by], “I will [to
have] mercy and not sacrifice.’  <span style="font-weight: bold">For* I
came, not to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance.

<sup>9:14</sup> Then the disciples of John come near to him,
saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but
your disciples do not fast?
<sup>9:15</sup> And Jesus said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">The <span style="font-weight: bold">sons of the
bridal-party <span style="font-weight: bold"> are not able to
mourn, inasmuch as the bridegroom is with them,
are they? But the days will come, whenever the
bridegroom is taken away from them and then
they will be fasting. <sup>9:16</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But no one puts a patch of
unshrunk fabric upon an old garment; for* its
fullness [shrinks and] lifts away from the garment
and a worse split happens. <sup>9:17</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Nor do they put
new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the
wineskins burst and the wine is poured out and
the wineskins will be destroyed, but they put new
wine into new wineskins and both are protected
together.


<sup>9:18</sup> [While] speaking these things to them, behold,
one ruler came to him [and] was worshiping [him],
saying, My daughter [just] now died*. But [after] you
[have] gone [to her],  lay your hand upon her and she
will live. <sup>9:19</sup> And Jesus raised himself [up and]
followed him and his disciples.
<sup>9:20</sup> And behold, a woman, having [had] a flow of
blood [for] twelve years, came near, behind [him and
]touched the hem of his garment; <sup>9:21</sup> for* she was
saying in herself, “If only I touch his garment; I will
be cured.
<sup>9:22</sup> Now Jesus having turned, saw her, and said,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Daughter, have courage; your faith has cured you.
And the woman was cured from that hour.

<sup>9:23</sup> And [after] Jesus came into the house of the
ruler and saw the flute-players and the crowd being
in an uproar, <sup>9:24</sup> he says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Depart<span style="font-weight: bold">°; for* the
girl has not died, but is sleeping. And they were
laughing at him. <sup>9:25</sup> But when the crowd was cast
forth, having entered, he took-hold of her hand, and
the girl arose. <sup>9:26</sup> And this fame went forth into that
whole land.


<sup>9:27</sup> And Jesus passing by from there, two blind
[men] followed him, crying out and saying, Show-mercy to us, son of David!
<sup>9:28</sup> Now he came into the house, the blind [men]
came to him and Jesus says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">You° believe
that I am able to do* this?
They say to him, Yes, Lord.
<sup>9:29</sup> Then he touched their eyes, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">Let it
happen for you° according-to your° faith. <sup>9:30</sup> And
their eyes were opened. And Jesus scolded them,
saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">See<span style="font-weight: bold">° [that] [you]° let no one know it. <sup>9:31</sup> But
they went forth and broadcasted [about] him in that
whole land.

<sup>9:32</sup> Now [while] they themselves are going forth,
behold, they brought a mute man to him being
demon-possessed. <sup>9:33</sup> And [after] the demon was cast
forth, the mute [man] spoke and the crowds marveled,
saying, It was never so manifested in Israel.
<sup>9:34</sup> But the Pharisees were saying, He is casting
forth demons in [the power of] the ruler of the demons.

{Mar 6:6b-13 & Mat 9:35-10:42 & Luk 9:1-6 Third circuit
of Galilee.}
<sup>9:35</sup> And Jesus was proceeding around all the cities
and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and
preaching the good-news of the kingdom and healing
every disease and every illness among the people. <sup>9:36</sup>
Now having seen the crowds, he had compassion
concerning them, because they were being bothered
[in spirit] and have been tossed [about], like sheep not
having a shepherd. <sup>9:37</sup> Then he says to his disciples,
<span style="font-weight: bold">The harvest is indeed large, but the workers [are]
few. <sup>9:38</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore beseech° of the Lord of the
harvest, *that he should put forth workers into his
harvest.

[Matthew 10] <a id="Mt10"></a>

<sup>10:1</sup> And having called his twelve disciples, he gave
to them authority [over] unclean spirits, so-then [they
are able] to cast them forth, and to heal every disease
and every illness.

<sup>10:2</sup> Now the names of the twelve apostles are
these: the first [is] Simon, who is called* Peter and
Andrew his brother; James and John his brother, the
[sons] of Zebedee; <sup>10:3</sup> Philip and Bartholomew;
Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the
[son] of Alphaeus and Lebbaeus who was surnamed
Thaddaeus; <sup>10:4</sup> Simon the Canaanite {Or: zealot. See
Luk 6:15, Acts 1:13.} and Judas the Iscariot, who also
gave him up[ to the Jews].


<sup>10:5</sup> Jesus sent forth these twelve [apostles and
]commanded them, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">Do°<span style="font-weight: bold"> not go into [any] road
of the Gentiles and do° not enter into [any] city of
the Samaritans; <sup>10:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">but travel°<span style="font-weight: bold"> rather to the lost
sheep of the house of Israel. <sup>10:7</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now [while] [you° ][are

following after me, is not worthy of me. <sup>10:39<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">He

[Matthew 11] <a id="Mt11"></a>

<sup>11:1</sup> And it happened when Jesus [had] completed
commanding his twelve disciples, he went-away
from there to teach and to preach in their cities.


<sup>11:2</sup> Now [after] John heard the works of the Christ
[while] in prison, he sent two of his disciples <sup>11:3</sup> [and]
said to him, Are you the one [who is] coming, or
[should] we expect a different [one]?
<sup>11:4</sup> And Jesus answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">[After]
traveling [back], report° to John what you° hear and
see: <sup>11:5</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  the blind recover [their ]sight and the lame
walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear,
the dead are raised and the poor are proclaimed
[the] good-news. <sup>11:6<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And whoever is not <span style="font-weight: bold">offended at
me is fortunate.

<sup>11:7</sup> Now [while] these [disciples] are traveling [on],
Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John,
<span style="font-weight: bold">What did you° go forth into the wilderness to see?
A reed shaken by the wind? <sup>11:8<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But what did you°
go forth to see? A man who has been dressed-up
in soft garments? Behold, the ones wearing soft
[garments] are in royal houses. <sup>11:9<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But why did you°
go forth? To see a prophet? I am saying to you°,
Yes, and [one who is ]more-than a prophet. <sup>11:10<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For*
this is he, concerning whom it has been written,
“Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
who will be preparing your way before you.’ {Mal
3:1}<span style="font-weight: bold"> <sup>11:11</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> Assuredly I am saying to you°, A greater
[man] has not been raised [up] among those born of
women [than] John the Immerser*. But he who is
least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater [than]
he. <sup>11:12<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But from the days of John the Immerser*
until now the kingdom of the heavens suffers-violently and [the] violent ones seize it. <sup>11:13<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For* all
the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
<sup>11:14<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And if you° are willing to accept [it], he himself
is Elijah, who is the one about to come.  <sup>11:15<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">He
who has ears to hear, let him hear.

<sup>11:16</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But to what will be similar to this
generation? It is similar to children sitting in the
marketplaces and shouting to their comrades <sup>11:17<span style="font-weight: bold">
</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">and saying, We piped to you° and you° did not
dance. We mourned for you° and [yet] you° did not
grieve for yourselves. <sup>11:18<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For* John came neither
eating nor drinking and they say, He has a
demon. <sup>11:19<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">The Son of Man came eating and
drinking and they say, Behold, a man [who is ]a
glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors
and sinners! And wisdom was made righteous
from her children.

<sup>11:20</sup> Then he began to reproach the cities in which
most of his miracles [had] happened, because they did
not repent. <sup>11:21</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! Because if the miracles which
happened in Tyre and Sidon the ones having
happened in you°, they would have repented long-ago in sackcloth and ashes.  <sup>11:22<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">However I say to
you°, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon
in [the] day of judgment than for you°.  <sup>11:23<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And
you, Capernaum, who was exalted to heaven, you
will be descending insofar as Hades, because if the
miracles which happened in Sodom, the ones
having happened in you, they would have
remained till today.  <sup>11:24</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> However I say to you°,
that it will be more tolerable for [the] land of
Sodom in [the] day of judgment, than for you.

<sup>11:25</sup> Jesus answered [and] said at that time, <span style="font-weight: bold">I
profess you, [O] Father, Lord of heaven and the
earth, that you hid these things from the wise and
intelligent and revealed them to infants. <sup>11:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Yes,
Father, because thus it became a delight before
you. <sup>11:27<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">All things were given to me by my Father

[Matthew 12] <a id="Mt12"></a>

{Mar 2:23-28 & Mat 12:1-8 & Luk 6:1-5 Jerusalem to
Galilee.}
<sup>12:1</sup> Jesus traveled [on] the Sabbath through the
grain-fields at that time, and his disciples were
hungry and began to pluck the tops and to eat [them].
<sup>12:2</sup> But the Pharisees, having seen [it], said to him,
Behold, your disciples are doing*  what is not legal to
practice on the Sabbath.
<sup>12:3</sup> But he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Did you° not read what
David did*, when he himself hungered and the
ones with him; <sup>12:4</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> how he entered into the house
of God and ate the showbread, which was not
legal for him to eat, nor the ones with him,
[unlawful] except for the priests only?  <sup>12:5<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Or have
you° not read in the law, that on the Sabbath the
priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and [yet]
are crimeless?  <sup>12:6<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But I am saying to
you°, that a greater thing [than] the temple is here. 
<sup>12:7<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But if you° had known what is [meant by this], “I
will [to have] mercy and not sacrifice,’ 
<span style="font-weight: bold">You° would not [have] sentenced the crimeless. <sup>12:8<span style="font-weight: bold">
</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For* the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.


<sup>12:9</sup> And having gone-away from there, he went
into their synagogue. <sup>12:10</sup> And behold, there was a
man who has a dried up hand. And they asked him,
in-order-that they might accuse him, saying, Is it
legal if [one was] to heal on the Sabbath?
<sup>12:11</sup> But he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">What man will there be
out-of you°, who will have one sheep and if this
[one] falls into a ditch on the Sabbath, will he not
take-hold of it and lift [it] up? <sup>12:12</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> Therefore how-much does a man carry more-value-than a sheep?
So-then is it legal to do* good on the Sabbath?
<sup>12:13</sup> Then he says to the man, <span style="font-weight: bold">Stretch out your
hand. And he stretched it out, and it was restored [as]
healthy as the other. <sup>12:14</sup> But the Pharisees having
gone forth, took a council against him, *that they
should destroy him.


<sup>12:15</sup> But Jesus having known [it], departed from
there and large crowds followed him, and he healed
them all, <sup>12:16</sup> and rebuked them, in-order-that they
should not make* him apparent; <sup>12:17</sup> *that what was
spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled,
saying, <sup>12:18</sup> “Behold, my young-servant whom I
selected. My beloved in whom my soul was
delighted. I will be placing my Spirit upon him and
he will be proclaiming judgment to the Gentiles.’ <sup>12:19</sup>
“He will not have selfish ambition, nor will he cry-out; nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets. <sup>12:20</sup>
He will not fracture a bruised reed and he will not
quench a smoking wick, until he should cast forth the
judgment to victory. <sup>12:21</sup> And the Gentiles will hope
in his name.’ 


<sup>12:22</sup> Then a demon-possessed [man] was brought to
him, blind and mute and he healed him, so-then the
blind and mute [man] [is able] both to speak and to see.
<sup>12:23</sup> And all the crowds were astonished and were
saying, This is not the son of David, is it?
<sup>12:24</sup> But [after] the Pharisees heard it, they said,
This one is not casting forth demons, except in
Beelzebub the ruler of the demons.
<sup>12:25</sup> But Jesus knowing their contemplations said
to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Every kingdom having been divided
against itself is made desolate, and every city or
house having been divided against itself will not
be established. <sup>12:26<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And if the Adversary casts
forth the Adversary, he was divided against
himself.<span style="font-weight: bold"> Therefore how will his kingdom be
established? <sup>12:27<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And if I cast forth demons in
Beelzebub, in <span style="font-weight: bold">whom do your° sons cast [them]
forth? They themselves will be your° judges
because of this. <sup>12:28<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But if I cast forth demons
with* [the] Spirit of God; consequently*<span style="font-weight: bold">, the
kingdom of God [has] arrived-unexpectedly upon
you°. <sup>12:29<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Or how is anyone able to enter into the
house of the strong [man,] and to be ravening
through his goods, if he does not first bind the
strong [man]? And then he will be ravening
through his house. <sup>12:30<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">He who is not with me is
against me and he who is not gathering together
with me scatters. <sup>12:31</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  Because of this, I am saying
to you°, Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven
to men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit will not be
forgiven to men. <sup>12:32<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And whoever speaks a word
against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him,
but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will
not be forgiven him, not in the age [which is] now,
nor in the future [one]. <sup>12:33<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Either make*&#176;<span style="font-weight: bold"> the tree
good and its fruit good; or make*&#176; the tree rotten
and its fruit rotten; for* the tree is known from
the fruit [it has]. <sup>12:34</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  Offsprings of vipers! How are
you°, being evil, able to speak good things? For*
out-of the abundance of the heart the mouth is
speaking. <sup>12:35<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">The good man out-of the good
treasure [in him], is casting forth good things and
the evil man out-of the evil treasure [in him], is
casting forth evil things. <sup>12:36<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But I am saying to
you°, that every idle declaration, whatever men
speak, they will be giving an account in [the] day of
judgment concerning it. <sup>12:37<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For* you will be made
righteous from your words and you will be
sentenced from your words.


<sup>12:38</sup> Then some of the scribes and Pharisees
answered [him], saying, Teacher, we wish to see a sign
from you.
<sup>12:39</sup> But he answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">An evil
and adulterous generation is seeking after a sign,
and a sign will not be given to it except the sign of
Jonah the prophet; <sup>12:40<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">for* just-like Jonah was
three days and three nights in the belly of the sea-creature; so will the Son of Man be three days and
three nights in the heart of the earth.
<sup>12:41</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">[The] men [of the] Ninevites will be standing
up with this generation in the judgment and will
be condemning it, because they repented at the
preaching of Jonah, and behold, more-than Jonah
[is] here. <sup>12:42<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">The queen of the south will be arisen
with this generation in the judgment and will be
condemning it, because she came from the limits
of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and
behold, more-than Solomon [is] here.
<sup>12:43</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But the unclean spirit, whenever it goes
away from the man, it goes through waterless
places, seeking rest and does not find it. <sup>12:44<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Then
it says, I will return into my house from where I
came forth, and having gone [back], it finds [it]
unoccupied, [that] it has been swept and has been
adorned.  <sup>12:45<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Then it travels and takes with itself
seven other spirits [more] evil [than] itself and [when]
it [has] entered [again], [they] dwell there and the last
[state] of that man becomes worse [than] the first. So
it will also be to this evil generation.


<sup>12:46</sup> But [while he is] still speaking to the crowds,
behold, [his] mother and his brethren stood outside,
seeking to speak to him. <sup>12:47</sup> Now someone said to
him, Behold, your mother and your brethren are
standing outside, seeking to speak to you.
<sup>12:48</sup> But he answered [and] said to the one who
spoke to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Who is my mother? And who are my
brethren? <sup>12:49</sup> And he stretched out his hand over
[toward] the disciples [and] said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Behold, my mother
and my brethren! <sup>12:50</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  For* whoever practices the
will of my Father [who is] in the heavens, he is my
brother and sister and mother.

<sup>13:1</sup> Now in that day, Jesus went away from the
house and was sitting beside the sea. <sup>13:2</sup> And large
crowds were gathered to [see] him, so-then he stepped
onto a ship to sit, and all the crowd stood upon the
beach.
<sup>13:3</sup> And he spoke many things to them in parables,
saying: <span style="font-weight: bold">Behold, the sower went forth to sow; <sup>13:4<span style="font-weight: bold">
</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">and while* he was sowing, some which fell beside
the road and the birds came and devoured them.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>13:5<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Now others fell upon the rocky-areas, where
it did not have much soil and immediately it rose
up because it had no depth of soil; <sup>13:6<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">and [after] <span style="font-weight: bold">the
sun rose, it was burnt, and it dried up because it
has no root.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>13:7<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Now others fell upon the thorns, and the
thorns shot-up and choked them.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>13:8<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But now, others fell upon the good soil and
was giving fruit, which some <span style="font-weight: bold">[was] a hundred [times],
but which [some was] sixty, but which [some was]
thirty.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>13:9<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

<sup>13:10</sup> And the disciples came near [and] said to him,
Why do you speak to them in parables?
<sup>13:11</sup> But he answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">It has
been given to you° to know the mysteries of the
kingdom of the heavens, but it has not been given
to those [men]. <sup>13:12<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For* who[ever] has, to him will be
given and he will abound, but who[ever] does not
have, even what he has will be taken away from
him. <sup>13:13<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Because of this, I speak to them in
parables, because seeing, they do not see, and
hearing, they do not hear, nor do they
understand. <sup>13:14</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  And the prophecy of Isaiah is
fulfilled in them, which says, “In hearing you° will
hear and should never understand, and seeing
you° will see and should never know; <sup>13:15<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">for* the
heart of this people became-callous and they [have]
selectively heard with the[ir] ears and they closed
their eyes; lest they should see with the[ir] eyes and
should hear with the[ir] ears and should
understand with the[ir] heart and should turn
again and I will be healing them.’ <span style="font-weight: bold"> <sup>13:16<span style="font-weight: bold">
</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But your° eyes [are] fortunate, because they are
seeing, and your° ears, because they are hearing.
<sup>13:17<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For*<span style="font-weight: bold"> assuredly I am saying to you°, that many
prophets and righteous [men] desired to see the
things which you° are seeing and did not see [them],
and to hear the things you° are hearing and did
not hear [them].

<sup>13:18<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore you°, hear° the parable of the
sower:  <sup>13:19<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">everyone hearing the word of the
kingdom and not understanding [it], [then] the evil
[one] comes and seizes what has been sown in his
heart. This is he who was sown beside the road.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>13:20<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And he who was sown upon the rocky-areas, this is he who hears the word and
immediately [is] receiving it with joy; <sup>13:21<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">but he
does not have root in himself, but is temporary,
and [after] affliction or persecution has happened [to
him] because of the word, immediately he
stumbles.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>13:22<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And he who was sown into the thorns, this
is he who hears the word, and the anxiety of this
age and the deception of riches, choke the word
and he becomes unfruitful.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>13:23<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Now he who was sown upon the good soil,
this is he who hears the word and understands it;
who bears-fruit and produces some a hundred
[times], and [some] sixty, and [some] thirty!

<sup>13:24</sup> He placed another parable before them,
saying: <span style="font-weight: bold">The kingdom of the heavens was
compared to a man who sows good seed in his
field; <sup>13:25<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">but while<span style="font-weight: bold">* the men were sleeping, his
enemy came and sowed darnels between [the stalks]
of the wheat and went away. <sup>13:26<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But when<span style="font-weight: bold"> the
blade sprouted and produced fruit, then [the]
darnels also appeared. <sup>13:27<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Now the bondservants
of the householder came near and said to him,
Lord, did you not sow good seed in your field?<span style="font-weight: bold">
Therefore from where have [the] darnels [come]?
<sup>13:28</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now he said to them, A man, an enemy,
did*  this.
<span style="font-weight: bold">Now the bondservants said to him,<span style="font-weight: bold"> Therefore
do you wish [that after ]we have gone away, [that] we
will collect them?
<sup>13:29</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But he said, No; lest [while] collecting [up] the
darnels, you° may uproot the wheat at the same-time with them. <sup>13:30<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Allow<span style="font-weight: bold">° both to be grown
together till the harvest, and I will be saying to the
reapers in [the] time of the harvest, Collect° first the
darnels and bind° them in bundles in order to
burn them, but gather° together the wheat into my
barn.


<sup>13:31</sup> He placed another parable before them,
saying: <span style="font-weight: bold">The kingdom of the heavens is similar to a
kernel of a mustard-seed, which a man took [and]
sowed in his field; <sup>13:32<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">which indeed is least
[compared to] all of the [other] seeds, but whenever it
is grown, it is greater [than] the herbs and becomes
a tree, so-then the birds of the heaven come and
nest in its branches.

<sup>13:33</sup> He spoke another parable to them: <span style="font-weight: bold">The
kingdom of the heavens is similar to leaven, which
a woman took [and] hid in three three-gallon-containers of flour, until which [time] it was
entirely leavened.

<sup>13:34</sup> Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the
crowds, and he was not speaking to them without a
parable; <sup>13:35</sup> *that what was spoken through the
prophet might be fulfilled, saying, “I will open my
mouth in parables. I will be uttering things which
have been hidden from the conception of the world.’



<sup>13:36</sup> Then Jesus, having left the crowds, went into
the house and his disciples came to him, saying,
Explain to us the parable of the darnels of the field.
<sup>13:37</sup> Now he answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">He who
is sowing the good seed is the Son of Man; <sup>13:38<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">and
the field is the world, and the good seed, these are
the sons of the kingdom, and the darnels are the
sons of the evil [one]; <sup>13:39<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">and the enemy who sowed
them is the devil and the harvest is the end of the
world, and the reapers are messengers. <sup>13:40<span style="font-weight: bold">
</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, just-like the darnels are collected and
burned in fire; so it will be in the end of this
world. <sup>13:41<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">The Son of Man will be sending forth
his messengers and they will be collecting out-of
his kingdom all the offenses and the ones
practicing lawlessness, <sup>13:42<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">and will be casting
them into the furnace of fire; the weeping and the
gnashing of teeth will be there. <sup>13:43<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Then the
righteous will be shining out like the sun in the
kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear,
let him hear.

<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>13:44<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Again, the kingdom of the heavens is
similar to a treasure which has been hidden in the
field; which a man having found, he hid, and he
proceeds away and sells all [his] things from his joy<span style="font-weight: bold">,
as many things as he has and buys that field.

<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>13:45<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Again, the kingdom of the heavens is
similar to a man, [who is] a merchant, seeking
beautiful pearls;  <sup>13:46<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">who found one [very] precious
pearl, went [and] has sold*<span style="font-weight: bold"> all [his] things, as many

<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>13:47<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Again, the kingdom of the heavens is
similar to a dragnet, which was cast into the sea

when<span style="font-weight: bold"> it was filled, they hauled it up upon the

good into containers, but they cast the rotten
outside. <sup>13:49<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">So it will be in the end of the world;
the messengers will be going forth and separate*
the evil from the midst of the righteous, <sup>13:50<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">and
will be casting them into the furnace of fire; the
weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be there.

<sup>13:51</sup> Jesus says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Have you° understood all
these things?
They say to him, Yes, Lord.

<sup>13:52</sup> Now he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Because of this, every
scribe who was made a disciple to the kingdom of
the heavens is similar to a man [who is] a
householder, who casts forth out-of his treasure,
new and old [things].

<sup>13:53</sup> And it happened, when Jesus [had] completed
these parables, he took off from there.


<sup>13:54</sup> And [after] he came into his fatherland, he was
teaching them in their synagogue, so-then [for] them to
be  astounded and to say, From where [did] this one
[receive] the wisdom and the miracles? <sup>13:55</sup> Is this not
the son of the carpenter? Is his mother not called*
Mary? And his brethren, James and Joses and Simon
and Jude? <sup>13:56</sup> And his sisters, are they not all with
us? Therefore from where [did] this one [receive] all
these things? <sup>13:57</sup> And they were being offended at
him.
But Jesus said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">A prophet is not without
honor, except in his fatherland and in his [own]
house. <sup>13:58</sup> And he did not do* many miracles there
because of their unbelief.

[Matthew 14] <a id="Mt14"></a>


<sup>14:1</sup> Herod the Tetrarch heard the report of Jesus at
that time, <sup>14:2</sup> and said to his young-servants, This is
John the Immerser*; he was raised from the dead, and
because of this, the[se] powers are working in him. <sup>14:3</sup>
For* Herod having taken-hold of John, bound him
and placed him in prison because of Herodias, his
brother Philip’s wife.
<sup>14:4</sup> For* John said to him, It is not legal for you to
have her.
<sup>14:5</sup> And wishing to kill him, [but] he feared the
crowd, because they held him as a prophet.
<sup>14:6</sup> Now Herod’s birthday-festivities being
brought* [together], the daughter of Herodias danced in
the midst [of the court] and pleased Herod; <sup>14:7</sup> from
where he confessed with an oath to give her whatever
she herself might ask for.
<sup>14:8</sup> Now having been pushed forward by her
mother, she says, Give me the head of John the
Immerser* upon a platter here.
<sup>14:9</sup> And the king was sorrowful, but because of the
oaths [he said] and [because of] the ones [who were
]reclining [at the meal] together-with [him], he
commanded it to be given. <sup>14:10</sup> And he sent [and]
beheaded John in the prison. <sup>14:11</sup> And his head was
carried upon a platter, and given to the girl, and she
carried it to her mother. <sup>14:12</sup> And his disciples came
near [and] lifted up the body, and buried it, and they
went [and] reported to Jesus.

{Mar 6:30-32 & Mat 14:13 & Luk 9:10 & Joh 6:1 East
shore of Galilee.}
<sup>14:13</sup> And [after] Jesus heard [it], he departed from
there in a ship, privately to a desolate place, and [after]
the crowds heard [of it,] they followed him on-foot
from the cities.


<sup>14:14</sup> And [after] Jesus went forth, he saw a large
crowd, and he had compassion upon them and healed
their sick. <sup>14:15</sup> Now [after] it became evening, his
disciples came near to him, saying, The place is
desolate and the hour [has] already passed away;
dismiss the crowds, in-order-that [after] they [have]
gone away into the villages, they might buy [various]
foods for themselves.
<sup>14:16</sup> But Jesus said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">They have no need to
go away; you°, give° them [food] to eat!

<sup>14:17</sup> But they say to him, We do not have [anything]
here except five loaves and two fish.
<sup>14:18</sup> Now he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Bring° them here to me. <sup>14:19</sup>
And he commanded the crowds to recline upon the
grass, [and] he took the five loaves and the two fish,
having looked up to heaven, he gave-thanks and
broke [them]. He gave the loaves to the disciples, and
the disciples [then gave] to the crowds. <sup>14:20</sup> And they
all ate and were fully-fed, and they took up what is
leftover of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full. <sup>14:21</sup>
Now the ones eating were approximately five
thousand men, plus women and children.


<sup>14:22</sup> And immediately, Jesus urged the disciples to
step onto the ship, and to precede him to the [area]
beyond-that, until which [time] he should dismiss the
crowds. <sup>14:23</sup> And having dismissed the crowds, he
went-up into the mountain privately to pray. Now
[after] it became evening, he was alone there. <sup>14:24</sup> But
the ship was already in the midst of the sea, [and] was
being tormented by the waves; for* the wind was
adverse. <sup>14:25</sup> Now in the fourth watch of the night
Jesus went to them, walking upon the sea. <sup>14:26</sup> And
[after] the disciples saw him walking upon the sea,
they were disturbed, saying, It is an apparition, and
they cried out from [their] fear.
<sup>14:27</sup> But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Have° courage; I am [here]; do° not be afraid.
<sup>14:28</sup> Now Peter answered to him, [and] said, Lord,
if you are [here], command me to come to you upon
the waters.
<sup>14:29</sup> Now he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Come.
And Peter descended from the ship, and walked
upon the waters to go toward Jesus. <sup>14:30</sup> But he was
afraid, seeing the strong wind, and began to sink, he
cried out, saying, Lord, save me!
<sup>14:31</sup> Now Jesus immediately stretched out his
hand, and grabbed him, and says to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Small faith
[ones!] In what were you skeptical?
<sup>14:32</sup> And [after] they themselves stepped into the
ship, the wind paused. <sup>14:33</sup> Now the ones [who are] in
the ship came [to him and], worshiped him, saying,
You are truly the Son of God.

<sup>14:34</sup> And having ferried over, they came to the land
[of] Gennesaret. <sup>14:35</sup> And [after] the men of that place
recognized him, they sent [word] into the whole region
around that [place] and brought to him all the ones
who have an ill[ness], <sup>14:36</sup> and they were pleading with
him in-order-that they might only touch the hem of
his garment and as many as touched [it,] were cured.

[Matthew 15] <a id="Mt15"></a>

{Mar 7:1-23 & Mat 15:1-20 & Joh 7:1 Galilee, probably
Capernaum Spring 29 AD.}
<sup>15:1</sup> Then the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem
come to Jesus, saying, <sup>15:2</sup> Why are your disciples
transgressing the tradition of the elders? For* they do
not wash their hands whenever they eat bread.
<sup>15:3</sup> But he answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why do
you° also transgress the commandment of God
because of your° tradition? <sup>15:4<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For* God
commanded, saying, “Honor [your] father and [your]
mother.’  <span style="font-weight: bold">And, “He who is
speaking evil of [their] father or mother, let him be
ended [by the sentence of] death.’  {Exo 21:17 & Lev
20:9}<span style="font-weight: bold"> <sup>15:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But you° say, Whoever says to the father
or the mother, [in] whatever you might be profited
from me, [it is] a gift [to God], <span style="font-weight: bold">and [then] should never
honor his father or mother,<sup> 15:6</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> and [thus] you°
invalidated the commandment of God because of
your° tradition. <sup>15:7</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> [O] hypocrites! Isaiah
prophesied well concerning you°, saying, <sup>15:8<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup>“<span style="font-weight: bold">This
people are drawing near to me with their mouth,
and are honoring me with the[ir] lips, but their
heart is distant, faraway from me. <sup>15:9<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But they are
worshiping me in futility, teaching [as their]
teachings the commandments of men.’ 
<sup>15:10</sup> And having called the crowd, he said to them,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Hear° and understand°! <sup>15:11<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Not what enters into
the mouth desecrates the man, but what is
traveling from the mouth, this desecrates the man.

<sup>15:12</sup> Then the disciples came near [to ]him[ and] said,
Do you know that the Pharisees were offended [after]
they heard the speech [of yours]?
<sup>15:13</sup> But he answered [and] said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Every plant which
my heavenly father did not plant will be uprooted.
<sup>15:14</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Leave<span style="font-weight: bold">° them! They are blind guides of [the]
blind. Now if the blind guide the blind, both will
be falling into a ditch.
<sup>15:15</sup> Now Peter answered [and] said to him, Explain
to us this parable.
<sup>15:16</sup> Now Jesus said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Are you° also without
understanding at this point? <sup>15:17<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Are you° not yet
perceiving, that everything which travels into the
mouth is making room in the belly, and is cast
forth into the sewer? <sup>15:18<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But the things traveling
out from the mouth, come forth from the heart,
and they desecrate the man. <sup>15:19<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For* out-of the
heart comes forth evil reasonings, murders,
adulteries, fornications, thefts, false* testimonies,
blasphemies. <sup>15:20</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  These things [are] what is
desecrating the man, but to eat with unwashed
hands does not desecrate the man.


<sup>15:21</sup> And Jesus went forth from there, [and] departed
into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.


<sup>15:22</sup> And behold, a woman from Canaan went forth
from those borders, [and] cried-out to him, saying,
Show-mercy [to] me, Lord, son of David. My daughter
is evilly demon-possessed. <sup>15:23</sup> But he answered her
not a word.
And his disciples came near and asked him,
saying, Dismiss her, because she is crying behind us.
<sup>15:24</sup> But he answered [and] said, <span style="font-weight: bold">I was not sent,
except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
<sup>15:25</sup> But she came and worshiped him, saying,
Lord, help me.
<sup>15:26</sup> Now he answered [and] said, <span style="font-weight: bold">It is not good to
take the children’s bread and cast it to the
puppies.
<sup>15:27</sup> But she said, Yes, Lord; for* even the puppies
eat from the crumbs, the ones falling from the table
of their lords.
<sup>15:28</sup> Then Jesus answered [and] said to her, <span style="font-weight: bold">O
woman, great [is] your faith. Let it happen for you
as you will [it].  And her daughter was healed from
that hour.


<sup>15:29</sup> And Jesus, having gone-away from there,
went beside the sea of Galilee, and he went-up into
the mountain [and] was sitting there.
{Mar 7:32-37 & Mat 15:30-31 Magadan and Bethsaida
Summer 29 AD.}
<sup>15:30</sup> And many crowds came to him [there], having
their [own] lame, blind, mute, crippled and many
others with them. They tossed them beside the feet of
Jesus, and he healed them; <sup>15:31</sup> so-then [for] the crowds
to marvel, seeing the mute speaking; the crippled
healthy; the lame walking; and the blind seeing; and
they glorified the God of Israel.


<sup>15:32</sup> Now Jesus called his disciples to him, [and]
said, <span style="font-weight: bold">I have compassion upon the crowd because
they already remain with me three days, and do
not have what they might eat, and I am not
willing to dismiss them starving, lest they might
faint on the road.
<sup>15:33</sup> And his disciples say to him, From where [can
we buy] so-many loaves for us in the wilderness, so-then to fully-feed so-great a crowd?
<sup>15:34</sup> And Jesus says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">How-many loaves
do you° have?
But they said, Seven and a few small-fish.
<sup>15:35</sup> And he commanded the crowds to lean-back
upon the soil. <sup>15:36</sup> And he took the seven loaves and
the [few] fish, [and] he gave-thanks [and] broke [them], and
gave to his disciples, and the disciples [gave] to the
crowd. <sup>15:37</sup> And they all ate and were fully-fed, and
they took up what is leftover of the broken pieces,
seven baskets full. <sup>15:38</sup> Now the ones eating were
[approximately] four thousand men, plus women and
children.

{Mar 8:10-26 & Mat 15:39-16:12 Near Caesarea Philippi
Summer 29 AD.}
<sup>15:39</sup> And having dismissed the crowds, he stepped
into the ship, and went into the borders of Magadan.

[Matthew 16] <a id="Mt16"></a>

<sup>16:1</sup> And the Pharisees and Sadducees came near,
testing [him, and] asked him to show them a sign from
heaven. <sup>16:2</sup> But having answered, he said to them,
<span style="font-weight: bold">[After] it became evening, you° say, [It will be] fair-weather; for* the heaven is red. <sup>16:3<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And in the

heaven is red and dismal. Hypocrites! You° indeed<span style="font-weight: bold">

the sign of Jonah the prophet. And he left them
[and] went away.

<sup>16:5</sup> And his disciples came to the [area] beyond-that, [and] forgot to take bread. <sup>16:6</sup> Now Jesus said to
them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Behold<span style="font-weight: bold">° and take-heed°, [stay] away from the
leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!
<sup>16:7</sup> Now they were reasoning among themselves,
saying, [It is] because we took no bread.
<sup>16:8</sup> Now Jesus having known it, said to them,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Small faith [ones]! Why are you° reasoning among
yourselves, because you° took no bread? <sup>16:9<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Do

understood that he did not say to take-heed, [stay
]away from the leaven of bread, but [stay] away from
the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

{Mar 8:27-30 & Mat 16:13-20 & Luk 9:18-21 Caesarea
Philippi.}
<sup>16:13</sup> Now [after] Jesus came into the parts of
Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Who do men say me (the Son of Man)<span style="font-weight: bold"> to be <span style="font-weight: bold">{i.e. I
am}?
<sup>16:14</sup> Now they said, Some [say] John the Immerser*;
others, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah or one of the
prophets.
<sup>16:15</sup> He says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">But who do you° say me to
be <span style="font-weight: bold">?
<sup>16:16</sup> Now Simon Peter answered [and] said, You are
the Christ, the Son of the living God.
<sup>16:17</sup> And Jesus answered [and] said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">You are
fortunate, Simon, Son-of-Jonah, because flesh and
blood did not reveal it to you, but my Father, the
[one] in the heavens. <sup>16:18</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But I also say to you, that
you are <span style="font-weight: bold">Peter <span style="font-weight: bold"> and upon this, <span style="font-weight: bold">the rock {i.e.

the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and
whatever you bind upon the earth will have
[already] been bound in the heavens, and whatever
you loose upon the earth will have [already] been
loosed in the heavens. <sup>16:20</sup> Then he ordered the
disciples in-order-that they should speak to no one
that he is Jesus, the Christ.
{Footnotes: Mat 16:18, these words are different in Greek.
Peter translated is a “pebble’ and the other word is “rock’ as in
“a massive rock or rock foundation,’ the kind of rock that the
wise man built his house on in Mat 7:24-25.}

{Mar 8:31-9:1 & Mat 16:21-28 & Luk 9:22-27 Caesarea
Philippi.}
<sup>16:21</sup> Jesus began to show to his disciples from then
[on], that it is essential [for] him to go to Jerusalem and
to suffer many things from the elders and high-priests
and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised in the
third day. <sup>16:22</sup> And Peter took him [and] began to
rebuke him, saying, [God will be] lenient to you, Lord.
This will never be [happening] to you.
<sup>16:23</sup> But he turned and said to Peter, <span style="font-weight: bold">Proceed
behind me, adversary! You are an offense to me,
because you are not mindful of the things of God,

<sup>16:24</sup> Then Jesus said to his disciples, <span style="font-weight: bold">If anyone is
willing to come after me, let him deny himself and
let him <span style="font-weight: bold">lift up his cross and let him follow me. <sup>16:25</sup>

<sup>17:1</sup> And after six days Jesus takes with [him] Peter
and James and John his brother, and privately brings
them [up] into a high mountain. <sup>17:2</sup> And he was
transfigured before them, and his face shined like the
sun, and his garments became white like the light. <sup>17:3</sup>
And behold, Moses and Elijah were seen with them,
speaking together-with him.
<sup>17:4</sup> Now Peter answered [and] said to Jesus, Lord,
it is good [for] us to be here; if you will [it.] Should we
make* three tabernacles here; one to you and one to
Moses and one to Elijah?
<sup>17:5</sup> [While][ he is] still speaking, behold, a radiant
cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out-of
the cloud, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">This is my beloved Son, in whom
I am delighted; hear<span style="font-weight: bold">° him!
<sup>17:6</sup> And [after] the disciples heard [it], they fell upon
their face, and were extremely afraid. <sup>17:7</sup> And Jesus
came near and touched them and said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Arise°, do° not
be afraid. <sup>17:8</sup> Now having lifted up their eyes, they
saw no one except Jesus only.
<sup>17:9</sup> And [while] coming-down from the mountain,
Jesus commanded them, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">Tell the vision to no
one, until which [time] the Son of Man should rise*
from the dead.
<sup>17:10</sup> And his disciples asked him, saying,
Therefore why do the scribes say that it is essential
[for] Elijah to come first?
<sup>17:11</sup> Now Jesus answered [and] said to them,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Indeed Elijah comes first and will be restoring all
things. <sup>17:12</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But I am saying to you°, that Elijah
already came, and they did not recognize him, but
did* with* him<span style="font-weight: bold"> as many things as they wished. So
the Son of Man is also about to suffer by them.
<sup>17:13</sup> Then the disciples understood that he said [this] to
them concerning John the Immerser*.

{Mar 9:14-29 & Mat 17:14-21 & Luk 9:37-43 Region of
Caesarea Philippi.}
<sup>17:14</sup> And [when] they themselves came to the crowd,
a man came near to him, kneeling [down to] him, <sup>17:15</sup>
and saying, Lord, show-mercy to my son, because he
is epileptic, and suffers evilly; for* he often falls into
the fire and often into the water. <sup>17:16</sup> And I brought
him to your disciples, and they were not able to heal
him.
<sup>17:17</sup> But Jesus answered [and] said, <span style="font-weight: bold">O unbelieving
and perverse generation, until when will I be with
you°? Until when will I tolerate you°? Bring<span style="font-weight: bold">° him
here to me. <sup>17:18</sup> And Jesus rebuked him, and the
demon went forth from him, and the boy was healed
from that hour.
<sup>17:19</sup> Then the disciples came near to Jesus
privately [and] said, Why were we not able to cast it
forth?
<sup>17:20</sup> Now Jesus said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Because of your°
unbelief. For*<span style="font-weight: bold"> assuredly I am saying to you°, If

{Mar 9:30-32 & Mat 17:22-23 & Luk 9:43-45 Return to
Galilee.}
<sup>17:22</sup> Now [while] turning back in Galilee, Jesus said
to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">The Son of Man is about to be given up
into the hands of men; <sup>17:23</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and they will be killing
him, and he will be arisen in the third day. And
they were extremely sorrowful.


<sup>17:24</sup> Now they went to Capernaum, the ones who
receive the four-denarii [tax] came to Peter and said,
Does your° teacher not pay the<span style="font-weight: bold"> four-denarii [tax]?
<sup>17:25</sup> He says, Yes.
And when he entered into the house, Jesus
anticipated him, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">What do you think,
Simon? The kings of the earth, from whom do
they receive taxes or tribute? From their sons or
from the aliens?
<sup>17:26</sup> Peter says to him, From aliens.
Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Consequently*<span style="font-weight: bold">, the sons are
free.  <sup>17:27<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But in-order-that we might not offend
them, [after] traveling to the sea, cast [in] a fishhook,
and lift [out] the fish ascending first, and <span style="font-weight: bold">[after] you
[have] opened the mouth [of it], you will find a four-denarii-coin. [After] you [have] taken it [out], give that
to them in exchange-for you and me.

<sup>18:1</sup> The disciples came to Jesus in that hour,
saying, Who then is greater in the kingdom of the
heavens?
<sup>18:2</sup> And Jesus, having called [to him] a child, stood
it in the midst of them, <sup>18:3</sup> and said,<span style="font-weight: bold"> <span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I am
saying to you°, If you° do not turn and become like
[young] children, you° should never enter into the
kingdom of the heavens. <sup>18:4</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, who will
be humbling himself like this [young] child, this one
is the greater one in the kingdom of the heavens.
<sup>18:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And whoever accepts one such child in my
name, accepts me. <sup>18:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But whoever offends one of
these little ones who believes in me, it is [more]
advantageous for him that* a millstone, [the ones]
rotated by a donkey, should be hung at his neck,
and [that* ]he should be sunk in the deep-sea of the
sea.
<sup>18:7</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Woe to the world from the [coming] offenses!
For* it is a necessity [for] the offenses to come;
however, woe to that man through whom the
offense comes! <sup>18:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now if your hand or your foot
is offending you, cut [both of] them off and cast
[them] from you. It is good for you to enter into life
lame or crippled, [rather] than to be cast into the
everlasting fire, having two hands or two feet.  <sup>18:9</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">And if your eye is offending you, pluck it out and
cast it from you. It is good for you to enter into
life one-eyed, [rather] than having two eyes, [and] to
be cast into the hell of fire.
<sup>18:10</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">See<span style="font-weight: bold">° [that] you° do not despise one of these
little ones; for* I say to you°, that in the heavens
their messengers are always looking at the face of
my Father [who is] in the heavens. <sup>18:11<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For* the Son
of Man came to save what has been lost.
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>18:12</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">What are you° thinking? If it should
happen to any man [who has] a hundred sheep, and
one out-of them might be misled, does he not seek
the one which is misled<span style="font-weight: bold">, having left the ninety-nine, traveling upon the mountains? <sup>18:13</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And if he
happens to find it,<span style="font-weight: bold"> assuredly I am saying to you°,
He rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine
which have not been misled.  <sup>18:14</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">So it is <span style="font-weight: bold">not the
will before your° Father [who is ]in the heavens,
that* one of these little ones should perish.


<sup>18:15</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now if your brother should sin at {i.e.
against}<span style="font-weight: bold"> you, proceed away and reprove him, [the
sin is] between you and him only; if he hears you,
you [have] gained your brother. <sup>18:16</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But if he does
not hear [you], take with you one or two more, in-order-that, “at the mouth of two or three witnesses
every declaration should be established.’  {Deu
19:15}<span style="font-weight: bold"> <sup>18:17</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But if he should refuse to hear them, tell
it to the congregation*, and if he also should
refuse to hear the congregation*, let him be just-like the Gentile and the tax collector to you.
<sup>18:18</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> Assuredly, I am saying to you°, As many
things as you° would bind upon the earth will
have [already] been bound in heaven, and as many
things as you° would loose upon earth will have
[already] been loosed in heaven. <sup>18:19<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I say
to you° again, that <span style="font-weight: bold">if two of you° agree together
upon the earth concerning any matter, whatever
they ask, it will happen for them from my Father
[who is] in the heavens. <sup>18:20</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* where two or three
are gathered together in my name, I am there in
the midst of them.

<sup>18:21</sup> Then Peter came near to him and said, Lord,
how-often will my brother sin against {Greek: at or
toward}<span style="font-weight: bold"> me [and] I will forgive him? Until seven-times?
<sup>18:22</sup> Jesus says to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">I do not say to you, Until
seven-times, but, until seventy-times seven. <sup>18:23</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> 
Because of this, the kingdom of the heavens was
compared to a man: a king who wished to settle
[the] account with his bondservants. <sup>18:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now
having begun to settle [the account], one [man] was
brought to him, a debtor of ten-thousand [silver]
talants <span style="font-weight: bold">.  <sup>18:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But he had
nothing to repay [him with], [so] his lord commanded
him and his wife and children and all things, as
many things as he was holding, to be sold*<span style="font-weight: bold"> and [the
money] to be repaid [to him].
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>18:26</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> Therefore the bondservant having fallen
[down], was worshiping him, saying, Lord, have
patience upon me, and I will be repaying all [of it]
to you. <sup>18:27</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But the lord of that bondservant,
having compassion on [him], released him and
forgave him the loan.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>18:28</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But that bondservant went forth [and] found
one of his fellow bondservants who owed him a
hundred denarii, and he took-hold of him, and
was choking [him], saying, Repay if you are owing
me anything.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>18:29</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> Therefore his fellow bondservant, having
fallen at his feet, was pleading with him, saying,
Have patience upon me and I will be repaying
you. <sup>18:30</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But he did not wish to, but having gone
away he cast him into prison, until he should
repay what is owed. <sup>18:31</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But his fellow
bondservants, having seen the things which
happened, were extremely sorrowful. And they
came to their [own] lord, and they told all the things
which [had] happened.
<sup>18:32</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Then having called him<span style="font-weight: bold">, his lord says to
him, Evil bondservant, I forgave you all that debt,
since you pleaded with me. <sup>18:33</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Was it not
essential [for] you to show-mercy also <span style="font-weight: bold">[on] your
fellow bondservant, like I also showed-mercy [to]
you. <sup>18:34</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And his lord was made angry, [and] gave
him to the torturers until he should repay
everything which is owed [to] him. <sup>18:35</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">So my
heavenly Father will also be doing*  to you°, if
each of you° does not forgive his brother their
trespasses from your° hearts.

[Matthew 19] <a id="Mt19"></a>


<sup>19:1</sup> And it happened, when Jesus [had] completed
these words, he took off from Galilee and came into
the borders of Judea beyond-that of the Jordan; <sup>19:2</sup>
and large crowds followed him, and he healed them
there.

<sup>19:3</sup> And the Pharisees came to him, testing him
and saying to him, If it is legal for a man to divorce
his wife according-to every cause?
<sup>19:4</sup> But he answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Did you°
not read, He who made*<span style="font-weight: bold"> [them], made* them male
and female from [the ]beginning.  <sup>19:5</sup>
And said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Because of this, a man will be leaving
the father and the mother and will be joined to his
wife, and the two will be [jointed] into one flesh.
 <sup>19:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">So-then they are no more two, but
one flesh. Therefore, what God yoked together; let
man not separate.
<sup>19:7</sup> They say to him, Therefore why did Moses
command [us] to give a document of divorcement and
to release her? 
<sup>19:8</sup> He says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Moses permitted* you° to
divorce your° wives for your° hardness of heart,
but from [the ]beginning it has not become so. <sup>19:9</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">But I am saying to you°, Whoever divorces his
wife not over 
<span style="font-weight: bold">fornication, and should marry another, is
committing adultery, and he who married the one
who has been divorced is committing adultery.

<sup>19:10</sup> His disciples say to him, If thus is the case of
the man with his wife, it is not advantageous to
marry.
<sup>19:11</sup> But he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Not all [people will] make
room for this word [in their hearts], but [they] to
whom it has been given: <sup>19:12</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">for* there are
eunuchs who were born so out-of [the] womb of
[their] mother, and there are eunuchs who were
made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who
made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom
of the heavens. He who is able to make room [in
his heart] <span style="font-weight: bold"> for [it], let him make room
for [it].


<sup>19:13</sup> Then [young] children were brought to him, in-order-that he might lay his hands upon them and
might pray [for them], and the disciples rebuked them.
<sup>19:14</sup> But Jesus said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Allow<span style="font-weight: bold">° the [young] children, and
do° not forbid them to come to me; for* the
kingdom of the heavens is of such. <sup>19:15</sup> And having
laid [his] hands upon them, he traveled from there.

{Mar 10:17-31 & Mat 19:16-20:16 & Luk 18:18-30
Peraea.}
<sup>19:16</sup> And behold, one [man] came near to [him and
]said to him, Good teacher, what good thing should I
practice in-order-that I may have everlasting life?
<sup>19:17</sup> Now he said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why do you call<span style="font-weight: bold">* me
good? No one [is] good except one: God, but if you
wish to enter into [everlasting] life, keep the
commandments.
<sup>19:18</sup> He says to him, What [ones]?
Now Jesus said,<span style="font-weight: bold"> Do not murder; Do not commit
adultery; Do not steal; Do not falsely testify, <sup>19:19</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> 
Honor [your] father and mother. {Exo 20:12-16 & Deu
5:16-20} <span style="font-weight: bold">And, You will love* your neighbor like
yourself. 
<sup>19:20</sup> The young-man says to him, I [have] observed
all these things from my youth. What am I still
lacking?
<sup>19:21</sup> Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">If you are willing to be
complete, proceed away, sell your possessions and
give to [the] poor and you will have treasure in
heaven and come-here. Follow me. <sup>19:22</sup> But [after]
the young-man heard the word, he went away, being
sorrowful; for* he was holding many properties.

<sup>19:23</sup> Now Jesus said to his disciples,<span style="font-weight: bold"> <span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I
am saying to you°, A rich [man ]will hardly enter
into the kingdom of the heavens. <sup>19:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But again I
am saying to you°, It is easier [for] a camel to go
through a needle’s eye, than [for] a rich [man ]to
enter into the kingdom of God.
<sup>19:25</sup> Now [after] his disciples heard it, they were
being extremely astounded, saying, Who then is able
to be saved?
<sup>19:26</sup> But Jesus, looked at [them] and said to them,
<span style="font-weight: bold">This is impossible with men, but all things [are]
possible with God.
<sup>19:27</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> Then Peter answered [and] said to him, Behold,
we left all and followed you; what then will be [left]
for us?
<sup>19:28</sup> But Jesus said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I am
saying to you°, that you° who [have] followed me,
whenever the Son of Man sits upon [the] throne of
his glory in the regeneration*, you° will also sit
upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel. <sup>19:29</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And everyone who [has] left houses or
brethren or sisters, or [their] father or mother or
wife, or children or fields, because of my name,
will be receiving a hundred-times [that], and will be
inheriting everlasting life. <sup>19:30</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But many will be
last [who are] first, and first [who are] last.

[Matthew 20] <a id="Mt20"></a>


<sup>20:1</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* the kingdom of the heavens is similar
to a man [who is] a householder, who went forth at
the same-time [every] morning to hire workers into
his vineyard. <sup>20:2</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And having agreed together with
the workers at a denarius a day {a standard day’s
pay}<span style="font-weight: bold">, he sent them into his vineyard. <sup>20:3</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And he
went forth around [the] third hour  <span style="font-weight: bold">[and]
saw others standing idle in the marketplace; <sup>20:4</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">and he said to those [men], You° also, proceed° into
the vineyard and I will be giving you° whatever is
just. <sup>20:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, they went forth around the sixth
 <span style="font-weight: bold">and he
did*  likewise*. <sup>20:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now around the eleventh hour,
 <span style="font-weight: bold">he went forth and found others
standing idle, and he says to them, Why are you°
standing here idle the whole day?
<sup>20:7</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">They say to him, Because no one hired us.
<span style="font-weight: bold">[So] he says to them, You° also, proceed<span style="font-weight: bold">° into the
vineyard and you° will be receiving whatever is
just. <sup>20:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now <span style="font-weight: bold">[after] it became evening, the lord of
the vineyard says to his commissioner, Call the
workers and [after] you have begun from the last
until the first, give to them the[ir] wage[s], . <sup>20:9</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And
<span style="font-weight: bold">[after] the [hired ones] around the eleventh hour {i.e.
5:00 PM}<span style="font-weight: bold">  came, they [each] received a denarius
apiece. <sup>20:10</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now <span style="font-weight: bold">[after] the first came, they
supposed that they will be receiving more, but
they themselves also received a denarius apiece.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>20:11</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But having received [it], they were
murmuring against the householder, <sup>20:12</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">saying,
These last ones did*  [only] one hour [of work], and
you made*<span style="font-weight: bold"> them equal to us, who bore the burden
of the day and the burning heat.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>20:13<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But he answered [and] said to one of them,
Comrade, I am not wronging you. Did you not
agree together-with me [for] a denarius? <sup>20:14</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Take
[up] the thing [which is] yours and proceed away. I
will to give to this last [one], as [I] also [did] to you. <sup>20:15<span style="font-weight: bold">

<sup>20:17</sup> And [while] going-up to Jerusalem, Jesus took
the twelve disciples privately on the road and he said
to them, <sup>20:18</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Behold, we go-up into Jerusalem, and
the Son of Man will be given up to the high-priests and scribes, and they will be condemning

<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>20:20</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with

<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>20:22</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> But Jesus answered [and] said, <span style="font-weight: bold">You° do not

<span style="font-weight: bold">They say to him, We are able<span style="font-weight: bold">.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>20:23</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> And he says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Indeed, you° will be
drinking my cup and you° will be immersed* [with]

Father. <sup>20:24</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> And having heard [this], the ten were
indignant concerning the two brothers.

that the rulers of the Gentiles are lording it over
them, and their great ones wield authority over
them. <sup>20:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But it will not be so among you°, but
whoever wishes to become great among you°, he
will be your° servant;  <sup>20:27<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">and whoever wishes to

from Jericho, a large crowd followed him. <sup>20:30</sup> And
behold, two blind [men] sitting beside the road, having
heard that Jesus is passing by, they cried out, saying,
Lord, son of David, show-mercy to us! <sup>20:31</sup> But the
crowd rebuked them, in-order-that they should be
silent, but they were crying out the greatest, saying,

<sup>21:1</sup> And when they drew near to Jerusalem and
came to Bethphage, toward the Mountain of Olives,

happened, in-order-that what was spoken through the
prophet might be fulfilled, saying, <sup>21:5</sup> “Say° to the

and the young-donkey and placed their garments
upon them, and he sat upon them. <sup>21:8</sup> But most of the
crowd spread their garments in the road, and others
were cutting branches from the trees and spreading
them in the road.
<sup>21:9</sup> Now the crowds, the ones preceding and the
ones following [him], were crying, saying, “Hosanna to
the son of David! The one coming in the name of the
Lord has been blessed!’ Hosanna in the highest!’ {Psa

<sup>21:12</sup> And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and
cast forth all the ones selling and buying in the
temple, and turned over the tables of the brokers and
the chairs of the ones selling the doves; <sup>21:13</sup> and he
says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">It has been written, My house will be
called a house of prayer, but you° made*<span style="font-weight: bold"> it a den

<sup>21:14</sup> And the blind and the lame came to him in the
temple, and he healed them. <sup>21:15</sup> But [after] the high-priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things
which he did*, and the boys crying out in the temple
and saying, Hosanna to the son of David!
They were indignant, <sup>21:16</sup> and said to him, Do you
hear what these are saying?
But Jesus says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Yes. Did you° never
read, “You completed for yourself praise out-of

tree upon the road, he came upon it and found
nothing in it, except foliage only, and he says to it,

<sup>21:20</sup> And [after] the disciples saw it, they marveled,
saying, How did the fig tree instantly dry up?

authority?
<sup>21:24</sup> But Jesus answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">I will

From men; we fear the crowd; for* all are holding
John [up] like a prophet. <sup>21:27</sup> And they answered Jesus
and said, We do not know.

<sup>21:33<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Hear<span style="font-weight: bold">° another parable: there was a certain

to farmers, and went-abroad. <sup>21:34</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now when the
time of the fruits drew near, he sent his
bondservants to the farmers, to receive his fruits.
<sup>21:35<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And the farmers took his bondservants who
they indeed whipped, [one] who they killed and [one]

bondservants, more-than the first, and they did* 
to them likewise*. <sup>21:37</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  But later he sent to them
his son, saying, They will revere my son. <sup>21:38</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But
the farmers, <span style="font-weight: bold">[after] they saw the son, said among
themselves, This is the heir. Come-here°. We

[him] forth outside the vineyard, and killed [him]. <sup>21:40</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> 
Therefore, whenever the lord of the vineyard
comes, what will he do*<span style="font-weight: bold"> to those farmers?
<sup>21:41</sup> They say to him, Evil [men]! He will evilly be
destroying them, and will be renting the vineyard out
to other farmers, who will be giving to him the fruits
at their seasons.
<sup>21:42</sup> Jesus says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Did you° never read in
the Scriptures, The stone which the builders
rejected*, this became the head of the corner; this

[has] fallen upon this stone, will be shattered, but

<sup>21:45</sup> And [after] the high-priests and the Pharisees
heard his parables, they knew that he is speaking
concerning them. <sup>21:46</sup> And seeking to take-hold of
him, [but] they feared the crowds, since they were
holding him [up] like a prophet.

[Matthew 22] <a id="Mt22"></a>


<sup>22:1</sup> And Jesus answered [and] spoke again to them
in parables, saying: <sup>22:2<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">The kingdom of the heavens
was compared to a man: a king who made*<span style="font-weight: bold"> a
marriage-festivities for his son, <sup>22:3</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and sent forth
his bondservants to call the ones who have been
invited to the marriage-festivities, and they were
not willing to come. <sup>22:4</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Again he sent forth other
bondservants, saying, Say° to the ones who have
been invited, Behold, I prepared my meal; the
oxen and the fattened [calves] have been sacrificed,
and all things [are] prepared. Come-here° to the
marriage-festivities. <sup>22:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But having neglected it,
they went away, one to [his] own field, and the [one]
to his merchandise; <sup>22:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">but the rest took-hold of
his bondservants, abused and killed [them]. <sup>22:7</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  And
that king, having heard [it], was made angry, and
[after] having sent his armies,  he destroyed those
murderers and scorched their city.
<sup>22:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Then he says to his bondservants, The
marriage is indeed prepared, but the ones who
have been invited were not worthy. <sup>22:9</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore,
travel° upon the thoroughfares of the roads, and
as many as you° would find, invite° to the
marriage-festivities. <sup>22:10<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And those bondservants,
having gone forth into the roads, gathered
together everyone, as many [people] as they found,
both evil and good and the marriage was filled
[with people] reclining [at the table].
<sup>22:11</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But [after] the king entered to look at the one
[who are] reclining [at the table], he saw a man there
who has not clothed himself with marriage attire;
<sup>22:12<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">and he says to him, Comrade, how did you
enter here not having [on your] marriage attire?
Now he was dumbfounded.  <sup>22:13</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Then the king
said to the servants, [After] you° [have] bound him
hands and feet, take° him away and cast° [him]
forth into the outer darkness; the weeping and the
gnashing of teeth will be there. <sup>22:14<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For* many are
invited, but few [are] chosen.

{Mar 12:13-17 & Mat 22:15-22 & Luk 20:20-26 Courtyard
of the Temple, Tues.}
<sup>22:15</sup> Then the Pharisees traveling [away], took a
council [on] how they might ensnare him in [his] speech.
<sup>22:16</sup> And they send their disciples to him, with the
Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that you are
true* and teach the way of God in truth, and do not
care concerning one[’s appearance]; for* you do not
look at [the] countenance of men. <sup>22:17</sup> Therefore tell us,
What do you think? Is it legal to give tribute to
Caesar or not?
<sup>22:18</sup> But Jesus, having known their wickedness,
said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why are you° testing me, [you°] hypocrites? <sup>22:19</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Show° me the tribute coin. Now they brought to him
a denarius. <sup>22:20</sup> And he says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Whose [face] is
this image and inscription? <sup>22:21</sup> They say to him,
Caesar’s. Then he says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore give° to
Caesar, the things [which are] Caesar’s, and to
God, the things [which are] God’s. <sup>22:22</sup> And having
heard [it], they marveled. And they went away, having
left him.

<sup>22:23</sup> [The] Sadducees came to him in that day, the
ones who are saying, [There is] to be no resurrection,
and they asked him, <sup>22:24</sup> saying, Teacher, Moses said,
If anyone dies, having no children, his brother will
marry his wife and will be raising* up seed to his
brother.  <sup>22:25</sup> Now seven brothers were with
us, and the first having married, [but after] he died*,
having no seed, left his wife to his brother; <sup>22:26</sup>
likewise also the second and the third, until the
seventh. <sup>22:27</sup> But after [them] all, the woman also died.
<sup>22:28</sup> Therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven in
the resurrection? For* they all had her [as a wife].
<sup>22:29</sup> But Jesus answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">You°
are [being] misled, [by] not knowing the Scriptures,
nor the power of God. <sup>22:30</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* they neither
marry, nor are betrothed in the resurrection, but
are like messengers of God in heaven. <sup>22:31</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But
concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you°
not read what was said to you° by God, saying, <sup>22:32</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">I am the God [of] Abraham and the God [of] Isaac
and the God [of] Jacob?  <span style="font-weight: bold">God is not the
God of [the] dead, but of [the] living. <sup>22:33</sup> And [after] the
crowds heard it, they were being astounded over his
teaching.


<sup>22:34</sup> But the Pharisees, having heard that he [had]
hushed the Sadducees, were gathered together upon
the same [ground]. <sup>22:35</sup> And one out-of them, a
professor of the law, asked [a question], testing him
and saying, <sup>22:36</sup> Teacher, what [is] the great
commandment in the law?
<sup>22:37</sup> Now Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">You will love* the
Lord your God in your whole heart and in your
whole soul and in your whole mind.  <sup>22:38<span style="font-weight: bold">
</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">This is [the] first and [the] great commandment. <sup>22:39<span style="font-weight: bold">
</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And [the] second [commandment] [is] similar to it, You
will love* your neighbor like yourself. 
<sup>22:40</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The whole law and the prophets are hung
[together] in these two commandments.


<sup>22:41</sup> Now the Pharisees having been gathered
together, Jesus asked them [a question], <sup>22:42</sup> saying,
<span style="font-weight: bold">What do you° think concerning the Christ? Whose
son is he?
They say to him, David’s.
<sup>22:43</sup> He says to them,<span style="font-weight: bold"> Therefore how does David
in [the] Spirit call him Lord, saying, <sup>22:44<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">The Lord
said to my Lord, Sit at my right, until I should
place your enemies [as the] footstool of your feet?
 <sup>22:45</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  Therefore, if David calls him Lord,
how is he his son?  <sup>22:46</sup> And no one was able to

<sup>26:35</sup> Peter says to him, Even if it is essential [for] me
to die together-with you, I should never deny you.
And all the disciples said likewise.


<sup>26:36</sup> Then Jesus comes to a parcel of ground with
them, called* Gethsemane, and says to the disciples,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Sit<span style="font-weight: bold">° [over] there, until which [time] I have gone [and]
might pray there*. <sup>26:37</sup> And he took Peter and the
two sons of Zebedee [and] began to be sorrowful and
to be disheartened. <sup>26:38</sup> Then Jesus says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">My
soul is very sorrowful until death. Remain<span style="font-weight: bold">° here
and watch° with me.
<sup>26:39</sup> And having gone a little [further], he fell upon
his face, praying and saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">My Father, if it is
possible, let this cup pass away from me; however,
not as I will, but as you [will].
<sup>26:40</sup> And he comes to the disciples and finds them
sleeping and says to Peter, <span style="font-weight: bold">So, were you° not strong-enough to watch with me one hour? <sup>26:41</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Watch°<span style="font-weight: bold">
and pray°, in-order-that you° may not enter into
temptation. The spirit [is] indeed eager, but the
flesh [is] weak.
<sup>26:42</sup> Having gone away again a second-time, he
prayed, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">My Father, if this cup is not able to
pass from me, if I do not drink it, let your will
happen.
<sup>26:43</sup> And he came again [and] finds them sleeping,
for* their eyes were heavy. <sup>26:44</sup> And having left them
again, he went away [and] prayed a third-time, [and]
said [again] the same speech.
<sup>26:45</sup> Then he comes to his disciples and says to
them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Are you°<span style="font-weight: bold"> furthermore sleeping the [time away]
and resting yourselves? Behold, the hour has
drawn near, and the Son of Man is given up into
the hands of sinners. <sup>26:46</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  Arise<span style="font-weight: bold">°, we should be
proceeding. Behold, the one giving me up [to the
Jews] has drawn near.
{Mar 14:43-52 & Mat 26:47-56 & Luk 22:47-53 & Joh
18:2-11 Gethsemane, Fri. a few hours before dawn.}
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>26:47</sup> And [while] still speaking, behold, Judas, one
of the twelve, came and with him, a large crowd with
swords and clubs, from the high-priests and elders of
the people. <sup>26:48</sup> Now the one giving him up, gave
them a sign, saying, Whomever I kiss; he is [the one];
take-hold° of him. <sup>26:49</sup> And immediately he came near
to Jesus [and said], Hail, rabbi. And he kissed him.
<sup>26:50</sup> But Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Comrade, upon what
[purpose] are you here? Then they came near and put
hands upon Jesus and took-hold of him. <sup>26:51</sup> And
behold, one of the ones [who was ]with Jesus stretched
out his hand [and] pulled the sword, and struck the
bondservant of the high-priest, [and] took off his ear.
<sup>26:52</sup> Then Jesus says to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Return your sword
into its place; for* all the ones who [have] taken [up
the] sword will be dying with* the sword. <sup>26:53</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Or do
you think that I am not able now to plead with my
Father and he will [not] stand beside me [with] more
than twelve legions of messengers? <sup>26:54</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> Therefore
how might the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it is
essential to happen [as] thus?
<sup>26:55</sup> Jesus said to the crowds in that hour, <span style="font-weight: bold">[Why] did
you° come forth with swords and clubs to take me<span style="font-weight: bold">,
like against a robber? I was sitting daily with you°
in the temple, teaching, and you° have not taken-hold of me. <sup>26:56</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  But this whole thing has
happened, in-order-that the Scriptures of the
prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples
left him and fled.

{Mar 14:53 & Mat 26:57 & Luk 22:54a & Joh 18:24 Palace
of Caiaphas, before dawn.}
<sup>26:57</sup> Now the ones who took-hold of Jesus led [him]
away to [the house of] Caiaphas the high-priest, where
the scribes and the elders were gathered together.

{Mar 14:54 & Mat 26:58 & Luk 22:54b-62 & Joh 18:15-18
Courtyard of High Priest’s residence, Fri. around dawn.}
<sup>26:58</sup> But Peter was following him from afar until
the courtyard of the high-priest, and entered inside,
and was sitting with the attendants, to see the end.


<sup>26:59</sup> Now the high-priests and the elders and the
whole council were seeking false* testimony against
Jesus, how they might slay him; <sup>26:60</sup> and they did not
find [any], even [though] many false* witnesses came.
[Still], they did not find [any]. <sup>26:61</sup> But later, two false*
witnesses came near and said, This one was saying,
I am able to tear-down the temple of God and to
build it [again] through   three days.
<sup>26:62</sup> And the high-priest, having stood up, said to
him, Are you answering nothing? What are these
[witnesses] testifying against you? <sup>26:63</sup> But Jesus was
silent. And the high-priest answered [and] said to him,
I implore you before the living God, in-order-that you
should tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God?
<sup>26:64</sup> Jesus says to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">You [have] said [so].
However<span style="font-weight: bold"> I am saying to you°, From now [on], you°
will see the Son of Man sitting at the right [hand] of
power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven.
<sup>26:65</sup> Then the high-priest ripped his garments,
saying, He blasphemed. Why do we still have need of
witnesses? Behold, now you° [have] heard his
blasphemy. <sup>26:66</sup> What are you° thinking?
And they answered [and] said, He is liable of death.
<sup>26:67</sup> Then they spat at his face and battered him, and
[some] slapped him, <sup>26:68</sup> saying, Prophesy to us, Christ.
Who is he who struck you?

{Mar 14:66-72 & Mat 26:69-75 & Luk 22:55-62 & Joh
18:25-27.}
<sup>26:69</sup> Now Peter was sitting outside in the
courtyard, and one maidservant came to him, saying,
You were also with Jesus the Galilean.
<sup>26:70</sup> But he denied [it] before them all, saying, I do
not know what you are saying.
<sup>26:71</sup> Now having gone forth into the gate [area],
another [one] saw him, and says to them there, This
one was also with Jesus of the Nazarenes.
<sup>26:72</sup> And again he denied with an oath, I do not
know the man.
<sup>26:73</sup> Now after a little [while], the ones standing [by],
came near and said to Peter, You truly also are [one]
out-of them; for* even your speech makes* it evident.
<sup>26:74</sup> Then he began to curse and to swear, I do not
know the man. And immediately, the rooster crowed.
<sup>26:75</sup> And Peter was reminded of the declaration of
Jesus, [when] he had said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Before the rooster
[is] to crow, you will be denying me three-times.
And having gone outside, he wept bitterly.

[Matthew 27]<a id="Mt27"></a> 

{Mar 15:1 & Mat 27:1-2 Luk 22:66-23:1 Joh 18:28a
Jerusalem early Fri. morning.}
<sup>27:1</sup> Now [after] it became morning, all the high-priests and the elders of the people took a council
against Jesus so-as to slay him; <sup>27:2</sup> and having bound
him, they led [him] away and gave him up to Pontius
Pilate the governor.

{Mat 27:3-10 & Acts 1:18-19 Fri. morning and toward the
future.}
<sup>27:3</sup> Then Judas, (the one giving him up), [after] he
saw that he was condemned, regretted [and] returned
the thirty [pieces of] silver to the high-priests and the
elders, <sup>27:4</sup> saying, I sinned, having given up innocent
blood.
But they said, What [is that] to us? You will see. <sup>27:5</sup>
And having tossed the [pieces of] silver in the temple,
he departed. And having gone away, he hung-himself.
<sup>27:6</sup> Now the high-priests took the [pieces of] silver
and said, It is not legal to put them into the
depository, since it is the price of blood. <sup>27:7</sup> Now they
took a council and bought from them the potter’s
field, *for the burial of strangers. <sup>27:8</sup> Hence  until
today, that field was called, The Field of Blood. <sup>27:9</sup>
Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet
was fulfilled, saying, “And they took the thirty [pieces
of] silver, the price of the one who had been priced,
whom [some] of the sons from Israel priced for
themselves; <sup>27:10</sup> and they gave them *for the potter’s
field, just-as the Lord commanded me.’ 


<sup>27:11</sup> Now Jesus stood before the governor and the
governor asked him, saying, Are you the King of the
Jews?
Now Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">You speak [it correctly].
<sup>27:12</sup> And while* he was accused by the high-priests
and the elders, he answered nothing.
<sup>27:13</sup> Then Pilate says to him, Do you not hear how-many things they are testifying against you? <sup>27:14</sup> And
he did not answer him, not even with one word; so-then [making] the governor to marvel exceedingly.

{Mar 15:6-19 & Mat 27:15-30 & Joh 18:39-19:16 Fri.,
April 7, 30AD.}
<sup>27:15</sup> Now the governor had been accustomed every
[Passover] feast to release one prisoner to the crowd,
whom they willed. <sup>27:16</sup> Now then they were holding
a notable prisoner called* Barabbas. <sup>27:17</sup> Therefore,
having been gathered together, Pilate said to them,
Whom do you° wish [that] I may release to you°?
Barabbas or Jesus who is called* Christ? <sup>27:18</sup> For* he
knew that they gave him up because of envy.
<sup>27:19</sup> Now [while] sitting upon the judicial-seat, his
wife sent to him, saying, [Have] nothing [between] you
and that righteous [man]; for* I suffered many things
today in a dream because of him.
<sup>27:20</sup> Now the high-priests and the elders persuaded
the crowds in-order-that they should ask for Barabbas
and should destroy Jesus. <sup>27:21</sup> But the governor
answered [and] said to them, Whom do you° wish [that]
I may release to you° from the two?
But they said, Barabbas!
<sup>27:22</sup> Pilate says to them, Therefore what should I
do* [to] Jesus who is called* Christ?

They all say to him, Let him be crucified!
<sup>27:23</sup> But the governor said, For* what evil did he
do*?
But they were crying out even-more, saying, Let
him be crucified!
<sup>27:24</sup> Pilate saw he is profiting nothing, but rather
that an uproar is happening, took water and washed
[his] hands in front of the crowd, saying, I am innocent
from the blood of this righteous [man]; you° will see [to
it].
<sup>27:25</sup> And all the people answered [and] said, His
blood [is] upon us and upon our children.
<sup>27:26</sup> Then he released to them Barabbas, but
having scourged Jesus, he gave [him] up in-order-that
he should be crucified.

<sup>27:27</sup> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus
into the palace [and] gathered together the whole
cohort  upon him. <sup>27:28</sup> And having
stripped him, they placed a scarlet cloak around him.
<sup>27:29</sup> And having braided a crown from thorns, they
placed it upon his head and a reed upon his right
[hand], and they knelt [down] before him [and] were
mocking him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! <sup>27:30</sup>
And having spat at him, they took the reed and were
beating [it] into his head.
{Mar 15:20-23 & Mat 27:31-34 & Luk 23:26-33 & Joh
19:17 Road to the Cross, Fri. morning.}
<sup>27:31</sup> And when they [had ]mocked him, they
stripped the cloak [off] him and clothed [him] with his
[own] garments and led him away, *that* they should
crucify him.

<sup>27:32</sup> Now [while] going forth, they found a man
from Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this
one to go [with them], in-order-that he might lift [up] his
cross.

<sup>27:33</sup> And they came to a place called* Golgotha,
which is called*, the place of a skull; <sup>27:34</sup> they gave
him vinegar to drink, having been mixed with gall.
And having tasted [it], he was not willing to drink [it].

{Mar 15:24-32 & Mat 27:35-44 & Luk 23:33-43 & Joh
19:18-27 9:00 until Noon, Fri.}
<sup>27:35</sup> Now having crucified him, “they divided his
garments, casting a lot'; <sup></sup> [in-order-that the Scripture
might be fulfilled, which says, “They divided my
garments among them and they cast a lot for my
garment.’]  <sup>27:36</sup> And sitting [down], they were
guarding him there. <sup>27:37</sup> And they placed above his
head an accusation which had been written, This
Jesus is the King of the Jews. <sup>27:38</sup> Then two robbers
are crucified together-with him, one at the right and
one at the left. <sup>27:39</sup> Now the ones who are traveling
by were blaspheming him, wagging their heads, <sup>27:40</sup>
and saying, He who tears-down the temple and builds
[it] in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of
God, come-down from the cross.
<sup>27:41</sup> Now likewise, also the high-priests with the
scribes and elders and Pharisees, mocking [him, and]
were saying, <sup>27:42</sup> He saved others[, yet] he is not able
to save himself. If he is [the] King of Israel; let him
come-down now from the cross and we will believe
in him. <sup>27:43</sup> He has confidence upon God. Let him
rescue him now, if he is willing [to save] him; for* he
said, I am the Son of God. <sup>27:44</sup> Now the robbers who
were also crucified together-with him were
reproaching him [with] the same thing.


<sup>27:45</sup> Now darkness became upon all the earth from
the sixth hour until the ninth hour {i.e. Noon until 3:00
PM; Amos 8:8-9?}.

{Mar 15:34-41 & Mat 27:46-56 & Luk 23:45-49 & Joh
19:28-30 around 5:00 PM.}
<sup>27:46</sup> Now around the ninth hour  Jesus
cried with a loud voice, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">Eli, Eli, lama
sabachthani? This is: “My God, my God, why did
you forsake me?’ 
<sup>27:47</sup> But some of the ones standing there, [after] they
heard it, were saying, This one is summoning Elijah.
<sup>27:48</sup> And immediately one out-of them ran, took a
sponge and filled [it] from [the] vinegar [vessel] and
placed it around a reed and was delivering a drink [to]
him.
<sup>27:49</sup> But the rest were saying, Allow [it, that] we
may see if Elijah comes; he will save him.
<sup>27:50</sup> Now Jesus, having cried again with a loud
voice, [his] spirit left. <sup>27:51</sup> And behold, the curtain of
the temple was split-apart into two [pieces,] from the
top to the bottom, and the earth shook, and the rocks
were split-apart; <sup>27:52</sup> and the tombs were opened, and
many bodies of the holy-ones who had fallen-asleep
were raised.
<sup>27:53</sup> And having gone forth out-of the tombs after
his awakening, they entered into the holy city and
were manifesting [themselves] to many.<sup></sup>
<sup>27:54</sup> Now the centurion and the ones guarding
Jesus with him, having seen the earthquake and the
things which happened, were extremely afraid,
saying, This one truly was the Son of God. <sup>27:55</sup> Now
many women were there viewing from afar, who [had]
followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him: <sup>27:56</sup> among
whom was Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother
of James and Joses and the mother of the sons of
Zebedee.

{Mar 15:42-47 & Mat 27:57-66 & Luk 23:50-56 & Joh
19:31-42 Before The Sabbath.}
<sup>27:57</sup> Now [after] it became evening, a rich man came
from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also made
himself a disciple to Jesus. <sup>27:58</sup> This one having gone
to Pilate,  asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate
commanded the body to be given [up]. <sup>27:59</sup> And Joseph
took the body [and] entwined it in a clean linen cloth,
<sup>27:60</sup> and placed it in his new tomb, which he [had]
hewed out in the rock and he rolled a great stone in
the door[way] of the tomb [and] went away. <sup>27:61</sup> Now
Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary were there,
sitting in front of the burial chamber.

<sup>27:62</sup> Now on the next-day, which is [the day] after
the Preparation, the high-priests and the Pharisees
were gathered together to Pilate, <sup>27:63</sup> saying, Lord, we
[have] remembered [what] that misleader said [while] still
living, I am raised after three days. <sup>27:64</sup> Therefore,
command [that] the burial chamber [is] to be made
secure until the third day, lest his disciples, having
come [by ]night, might steal him away and might say
to the people, He was raised from the dead and the
last deceit will be worse [than] the first.
<sup>27:65</sup> Now Pilate said to them, You° have a sentry.
Proceed° away, make° [it as] secure as you° know [how].
<sup>27:66</sup> Now traveling [away], they secured the burial
chamber, having sealed the stone, [and] with the
sentry.

[Matthew 28] <a id="Mt28"></a>

{Mar 16:1-8 & Mat 28:1-8 & Luk 24:1-8, 12 & Joh 20:1-10
Dawn and very early Sun.}
<sup>28:1</sup> Now after the Sabbath, [as it was] dawning
toward the first [daylight] of the week, Mary the
Magdalene and the other Mary came to view the
burial chamber. <sup>28:2</sup> And behold, a great earthquake
happened; for* a messenger of the Lord descended
out-of heaven, who came near [and] rolled away the
stone from the door and was sitting upon it. <sup>28:3</sup> His
form was like lightning and his clothing [was] white
like snow; <sup>28:4</sup> and the ones guarding [the door], were
shaken from [the] fear of him and became like dead
[men].
<sup>28:5</sup> Now the messenger answered [and] said to the
women, Do° not be afraid; for* I know that you° are
seeking Jesus, who has been crucified. <sup>28:6</sup> He is not
here; for* he was raised, just-as he said. Come-here°,
behold° the place where the Lord was laying. <sup>28:7</sup> And
traveling quickly, say° to his disciples, He was raised
from the dead, and behold, he is preceding you° into
Galilee; you° will be seeing him there. Behold, I [have]
said [this] to you°.
<sup>28:8</sup> And having gone forth quickly from the tomb
with fear and great joy, they ran to report to his
disciples.

<sup>28:9</sup> Now as they were traveling to also report [it] to
his disciples, behold, Jesus encountered them, saying,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Rejoice<span style="font-weight: bold">°! But they came and took-hold of his feet and
worshiped him. <sup>28:10</sup> Then Jesus says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Do°<span style="font-weight: bold"> not
be afraid. Proceed° away; report° to my brethren
in-order-that they might go into Galilee and they
will be seeing me there.


<sup>28:11</sup> Now [while] they [are] traveling, behold, some of
the sentry came into the city and reported to the high-priests all the things which [had] happened. <sup>28:12</sup> And
having been gathered together with the elders and
having taken council, they gave a considerable
[amount of] silver to the soldiers, <sup>28:13</sup> saying, Say°: the
disciples stole him from us, being fallen-asleep, [after]
they came from [the] night,. <sup>28:14</sup> And if this thing is
heard [of] over [at] the governor, we will be persuading
him and will be making* you° carefree. <sup>28:15</sup> Having
taken the silver, they did*  like they were taught and
this speech was broadcasted with the Jews [and is
continuing] till today.


<sup>28:16</sup> But the eleven disciples traveled into Galilee,
to the mountain where Jesus [had] appointed to them.
<sup>28:17</sup> And having seen him, they worshiped him, but
they were skeptical.

{Mar 16:15-18 & Mat 28:18-20 & Luk 24:46-47 Mountain
in Galilee; The Great Commission.}
<sup>28:18</sup> And Jesus came near [and] spoke to them,
saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">All authority was given to me in heaven
and upon earth.
<sup>28:19<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">[When] traveling, make° disciples of all the

{{ Introduction to Mark 45-52 AD.

The book of Mark, better titled as “The Good-news
According-to Mark,' was written for a Roman audience. The
author of the book does not identify himself, but the early
Christian congregations attributed the authorship to John Mark,
cousin of Barnabas and possibly Peter’s son. It is fast paced and
should have been the first book of the New Testament. With this
in mind, many feel this gospel was written primarily to the
Romans who were very industrious and proud of their
achievements. Jesus' heroic service to others and His willingness
to die for others would attract Roman attention too. The Romans
were not interested in lots of extra details, nor were they too
concerned about prophecies contained in Jewish writings from
hundreds of years earlier (Mark only quotes three Old
Testament prophecies). Mark even disregards many instances of
special Jewish interest and explains Jewish customs and
language for non-Jewish readers (5:41; 7:34; 15:34). Mark gives
us one of the three reasons for Jesus’ death: A ransom for many
- 10:45. For the forgiveness of sins - Matthew 26:28. For the
sheep - John 10:11. Isaiah 52:13-53:12 is the very relevant
background for this Good-news book. The events in Mark are
held by scholars to be in chronological order. Starting from His
immersion (baptism) Mark portrays Jesus as a Man constantly
on the move for God, with the word “immediately' appearing 42
times in this book, the shortest of the Good-news accounts.
Percentage-wise, Mark spends more time dealing with the final
week of Jesus' life than any of the other Good-news writers. The
final instructions given by Jesus after His resurrection, in this
biography, are to “preach the good-news to the whole creation.
He who believes and is immersed will be saved, but he who
disbelieves will be condemned' (Mark 16:15-16).}}

{Mar 1:1-8 & Mat 3:1-12 & Luk 3:1-18. Judea near Jordan
River 25 or 26 AD.}
<sup>1:1</sup> [The] beginning of the good-news of Jesus
Christ, the Son of God. <sup>1:2</sup> As it has been written in
the prophets, “Behold, I send my messenger before
your face, who will be preparing your way.’ 
<sup>1:3</sup> “The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
prepare° the way of the Lord; make*&#176; his paths
straight.’  <sup>1:4</sup> John came*, immersing* in the
wilderness and preaching the immersion* of
repentance into [the] forgiveness of sins. <sup>1:5</sup> And all the
region of Judea and [those from] Jerusalem were
traveling out to him, and all were being immersed* by
him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. <sup>1:6</sup> Now
John was eating locusts and wild honey, having
clothed himself with camel’s hair, and a leather belt
around his loin.

<sup>1:7</sup> And he preached, saying, He is coming after
me, the mightier [one][ than I]. I am not sufficient,
having stooped [down,] to loose the strap of his shoes.
<sup>1:8</sup> I indeed immersed* you° in water, but he will
immerse* you° in [the] Holy Spirit.

{Mar 1:9-11 & Mat 3:13-17 Luk 3:21-22 Jordan east of
Jericho, Spring 27 AD.}
<sup>1:9</sup> And it happened in those days, [that] Jesus came
from Nazareth of Galilee, and was immersed* by
John into the Jordan. <sup>1:10</sup> And immediately coming-up
from the water, he saw the heavens being split-apart,
and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him. <sup>1:11</sup>
And a voice came* out-of the heavens, <span style="font-weight: bold">You are my
beloved Son, in whom I am delighted.


<sup>1:12</sup> And immediately the Spirit cast him forth into
the wilderness. <sup>1:13</sup> And he was there in the
wilderness [for] forty days, being tempted by the
Adversary, and he was with the beasts, and the
messengers were serving him.

<sup>1:14</sup> Now after John was given up,

Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the good-news
of the kingdom of God, <sup>1:15</sup> and saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">The time has
been fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn
near. Repent<span style="font-weight: bold">° and believe° in the good-news.

 {Mat 4:13-16
Capernaum.}
{Mar 1:16-20 & Mat 4:18-22 & Luk 5:1-11 Sea of Galilee
near Capernaum.}
<sup>1:16</sup> Now walking beside the sea of Galilee, he saw
Simon and Andrew his brother, [who are] Simon’s
[sons], casting a net in the sea; for* they were
fishermen. <sup>1:17</sup> And Jesus said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Come-here<span style="font-weight: bold">°
after me and I will make* you° to become
fishermen of men. <sup>1:18</sup> And immediately they left
their nets [and] followed him. <sup>1:19</sup> And having
advanced a few [feet] from there, he saw James and
John his brother, the [sons] of Zebedee, and they [were]
in the ship mending the nets. <sup>1:20</sup> And immediately he
called them, and they left their father Zebedee with
the hired-servants in the ship [and] went after him.


<sup>1:21</sup> And they travel into Capernaum, and he
immediately entered into the synagogue  on the
Sabbath[ and] was teaching. <sup>1:22</sup> And they were being
astounded at his teaching; for* he was teaching them
like [one] having authority and not like the scribes.
<sup>1:23</sup> And a man was in their synagogue in [him was]
an unclean spirit, and he cried out, <sup>1:24</sup> saying, Ah!
What [is this thing] with us and with you, Jesus [the]
Nazarene? Did you come to destroy us? I know you,
[I know] who you are, the Holy One of God.
<sup>1:25</sup> And Jesus rebuked it, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">Hush and come
forth out-of him.
<sup>1:26</sup> And the unclean spirit went forth out-of him,
having convulsed him and having cried out with a
loud voice. <sup>1:27</sup> And they were all amazed, so-then
[they began] to debate together-with themselves,
saying, What is this thing? What new teaching [is] this
that he commands even the unclean spirits according-to [God's] authority, and they are obeying* him?
<sup>1:28</sup> Now the report of him went forth immediately,
into the whole region around Galilee.


<sup>1:29</sup> And immediately, they came forth out-of the
synagogue, [and] they came into the house of Simon
and Andrew, with James and John. <sup>1:30</sup> Now Simon’s
mother-in-law was reclining, fevered, and
immediately they speak to him concerning her. <sup>1:31</sup>
And he came near [and] lifted her up, having taken-hold of her hand, and immediately the fever left her
and she was serving them.


<sup>1:32</sup> Now [after] it became evening, when the sun
set, they were bringing to him all who have an ill[ness]
and the ones being demon-possessed. <sup>1:33</sup> And the
whole city was being gathered together [next] to the
door. <sup>1:34</sup> And he healed many having an ill[ness] with
various diseases, and cast forth many demons, and he
was not allowing the demons to speak, because they
knew him.

{Mar 1:35-39 & Mat 4:23-25 & Luk 4:42-44 Preaching
through Galilee.}
<sup>1:35</sup> And exceedingly [early,] having risen* up in the
morning, [while yet] at night, he came forth and went
away into a desolate place, and he was praying there.
<sup>1:36</sup> And Simon, and the ones with him, pursued him;
<sup>1:37</sup> and having found him, they say to him, All are
seeking you.

<sup>1:38</sup> And he says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">We should be
proceeding into the next towns, in-order-that I
should also preach there; for* I have come *for
this [purpose]. <sup>1:39</sup> And he was preaching and casting
forth demons in their synagogues in the whole [of]
Galilee.


<sup>1:40</sup> And a leper comes to him, pleading with him,
and kneeling [down] to him and saying to him, If you
are willing, you are able to cleanse me.
<sup>1:41</sup> Now Jesus, having compassion on [him],
stretched out his hand, touched him and says to him,
<span style="font-weight: bold">I am willing. Be cleansed. <sup>1:42</sup> And having said [that],
the leprosy immediately went away from him and he
was cleansed. <sup>1:43</sup> And having scolded him, he
immediately put him forth, <sup>1:44</sup> and says to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">See
[that] you say nothing to anyone, but proceed away;
show yourself to the priest, and offer the thing
which Moses commanded concerning your
cleansing *for a testimony to them.  <sup>1:45</sup> But he went forth and began to preach [it] much,
and to broadcast the word, so-then he  was
no longer able to openly enter into [the] city, but was
outside in desolate places, and they were coming to
him from everywhere.

[Mark 2] <a id="Mk2"></a>


<sup>2:1</sup> And he again entered into Capernaum after
[several ]days, and it was heard that he is in a house
[there]. <sup>2:2</sup> And immediately many were gathered
together, so-then [it was] no longer [possible] to make
room, not even [next] to the door, and he was speaking
the word to them.
<sup>2:3</sup> And they come, carrying to him a paralytic,
lifted up by four [men.] <sup>2:4</sup> And not being able to draw
near to him because of the crowd, they unroofed the
roof where he was. And they shoveled [a hole in it],
[and] lower the pallet upon which the paralytic was
laying. <sup>2:5</sup> Now Jesus saw their faith {Or: belief; and
throughout the N.T.} and says to the paralytic, <span style="font-weight: bold">Child,
your sins have been forgiven to you.
<sup>2:6</sup> But some of the scribes were sitting there and
reasoning in their hearts, <sup>2:7</sup> Why is this one speaking
blasphemies so? Who is able to forgive sins except
one, [our] God?
<sup>2:8</sup> And immediately Jesus, having fully known in
his spirit that they reason so in themselves, said to
them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why are you° reasoning these things in
your° hearts?  <sup>2:9</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">What is easier to say to the
paralytic, Your sins have been forgiven; or to say,
Lift yourself up, and take up your pallet and
walk? <sup>2:10<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But in-order-that you° may know that
the Son of Man has authority upon the earth to
forgive sins (he says to the paralytic), <sup>2:11</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">I say to
you, Lift yourself up, and take up <span style="font-weight: bold">pallet and
proceed away to your house.
<sup>2:12</sup> And he immediately arose, and having lifted
up the pallet, went forth in front of [them] all; so-then
[for] all to be astonished and to glorify God, saying,
We never saw [this happen] so.

{Mar 2:13-14 & Mat 9:9 & Luk 5:27-28 At or near
Capernaum.}
<sup>2:13</sup> And he went forth again beside the sea, and all
the crowd was coming to him and he was teaching
them. <sup>2:14</sup> And passing by, he saw Levi the [son] of
Alphaeus sitting at the tax-office, and he says to him,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Follow me. And he stood up [and] followed him.


<sup>2:15</sup> And it happened, while* he was reclining [at a
meal] in his house, many tax collectors and sinners
were also reclining together-with Jesus and his
disciples; for* many were [there], and they followed
him. <sup>2:16</sup> And the scribes and the Pharisees, having
seen him eating with the tax collectors and sinners,
were saying to his disciples, Why [is it] that he is
eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners?
<sup>2:17</sup> And [after] Jesus heard it, he says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">The
ones who are strong have no need of a physician,
but the ones [who are ]ill. I came, not to call the
righteous, but sinners to repentance.

<sup>2:18</sup> And the disciples of John, and the ones of the
Pharisees, were fasting, and they come and say to
him, Why do the disciples of John and the ones of the
Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?
<sup>2:19</sup> And Jesus said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">The <span style="font-weight: bold">sons<span style="font-weight: bold"> of the
bridal-party <span style="font-weight: bold"> are not able to
fast at which [time] the bridegroom is with them,
are they? Inasmuch time as they have the
bridegroom with themselves, they are not able to
fast. <sup>2:20<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But the days will come, whenever the
bridegroom is taken away from them and then
they will be fasting in those days. <sup>2:21</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And no one
sews a patch of unshrunk fabric upon an old
garment; otherwise its fullness [shrinks and] lifts
the new [patch] away from the old one and a worse
split happens. <sup>2:22</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And no one puts new wine into
old wineskins; otherwise the new wine [will] burst
the wineskins, and the wine is poured out and the
wineskins will be destroyed, but new wine [is] put
into new wineskins.


<sup>2:23</sup> And he happened to travel on the Sabbath
through the grain-fields, and his disciples began to
make* [their] way plucking the tops. <sup>2:24</sup> And the
Pharisees were saying to him, Behold, why are they
doing*  what is not legal on the Sabbath?
<sup>2:25</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Have you° never read
what David did*, when he himself had need, being
hungry, and the ones with him <span style="font-weight: bold">? <sup>2:26<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">How he
entered into the house of God in [the days of]
Abiathar [the] high-priest and ate the showbread,
which is not legal to eat, except for the priests,
and he also gave [it] to the ones who being together-with him?  <sup>2:27</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">The
Sabbath came*<span style="font-weight: bold"> [to be] because of man [and] not man
because of the Sabbath; <sup>2:28</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">so-then, the Son of
Man is lord even of the Sabbath.

[Mark 3] <a id="Mk3"></a>


<sup>3:1</sup> And he entered again into the synagogue, and a
man having a dried up hand was there. <sup>3:2</sup> And they
were observing him, if he will heal him on the
Sabbath, in-order-that they might accuse him. <sup>3:3</sup> And
he says to the man the one having the hand which
had been dried up, [<span style="font-weight: bold">You]<span style="font-weight: bold"> in the middle, lift yourself
up!  <sup>3:4</sup> And he says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Is it legal on the
Sabbath to do good or to do*<span style="font-weight: bold"> evil? To save a life or
to kill? But they were silent. <sup>3:5</sup> And having looked
around [at] them with anger, being sorrowful at the
hardening of their heart, he says to the man, <span style="font-weight: bold">Stretch
out your hand. And he stretched it out, and his hand
was restored [as] healthy as the other. <sup>3:6</sup> And the
Pharisees went forth [and] were immediately making*
a council against him with the Herodians, how they
might destroy him.


<sup>3:7</sup> And Jesus departed to the sea with his disciples,
and a large multitude followed him from Galilee and
from Judea, <sup>3:8</sup> and from Jerusalem and from
Idumaea, and beyond-that of the Jordan, and the ones
around Tyre and Sidon. [This] large multitude, having
heard how-much he was doing*, came to him. <sup>3:9</sup> And
he spoke to his disciples; in-order-that a small-boat
should wait-on him because of the crowd, in-order-that they might not press against him. <sup>3:10</sup> For* he
healed many; so-then as many as had disorders [tried]
to fall upon him, in-order-that they might touch him.
<sup>3:11</sup> And the unclean spirits, whenever they were
viewing him, were falling before him and cried,
saying, You are the Son of God. <sup>3:12</sup> And he was
rebuking them much, in-order-that they might not
make* him apparent.


<sup>3:13</sup> And he goes-up into the mountain and calls to
[himself ]whom he wished, and they went to him. <sup>3:14</sup>
And he made* [the appointment of the] twelve, in-order-that they might be with him and in-order-that
he may send them forth to preach, <sup>3:15</sup> and to have
authority to heal the diseases and to cast forth
demons. <sup>3:16</sup> And he added the name Peter to Simon;
<sup>3:17</sup> and James the [son] of Zebedee and John the
brother of James, and he added to them the names
Boanerges, which is, Sons of Thunder; <sup>3:18</sup> and
Andrew and Philip and Bartholomew and Matthew
and Thomas and James the [son] of Alphaeus and
Thaddaeus and Simon the Canaanite, <sup>3:19</sup> and Judas
Iscariot, who also gave him up [to the Jews].



 {Mat 7:12 & Luk
6:31.}  {Mat 7:24-29 & Luk

Galilee.}  {Luk 8:1-3 Journeying in
Galilee.}


And they come into a house. <sup>3:20</sup> And a crowd
comes together again, so-as[ for ]them to not even be
able to eat bread. <sup>3:21</sup> And [after] the ones [close] beside
him heard it, they went forth to take-hold of him; for*
they were saying that he was crazy.
<sup>3:22</sup> And the scribes that came-down from
Jerusalem were saying, He has Beelzebub, and, He is
casting forth the demons by the ruler of the demons.
<sup>3:23</sup> And having called them, he was speaking to
them in parables: <span style="font-weight: bold">How is [the] Adversary able to cast
forth [the] Adversary? <sup>3:24<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And if a kingdom is
divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to
stand. <sup>3:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And if a house is divided against itself,
that house is not able to stand. <sup>3:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And if the
Adversary [has] stood up against himself, and has
been divided, he is not able to stand, but has [come
to] an end. <sup>3:27<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">No one having entered into the house
of the strong [man] is able to be ravening through
his goods, if he does not first bind the strong [man],
and then he may be ravening through his house.
<sup>3:28</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I am saying to you°, All the[ir] sins
and blasphemies <span style="font-weight: bold">will be forgiven to the sons of
men; as many things as they would blaspheme. <sup>3:29<span style="font-weight: bold">
</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But whoever might blaspheme <span style="font-weight: bold">at the Holy Spirit
does not have forgiveness, forever, but is liable to
an everlasting judgment. <sup>3:30</sup> (Because they were
saying, “He has an unclean spirit.’)



<sup>3:31</sup> Therefore [his] brethren and his mother come,
and standing outside, they sent to him, summoning
him. <sup>3:32</sup> And a crowd was sitting around him, and
they said to him, Behold, your mother and your
brothers and your sisters are outside seeking you.
<sup>3:33</sup> And he answered them, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">Who is my
mother or my brethren? <sup>3:34</sup> And having looked
around in a circle [at those] sitting around him, he
says, <span style="font-weight: bold">Behold, my mother and my brethren! <sup>3:35<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For*
whoever  practices the will of God, this one is my
brother and sister and mother.

[Mark 4] <a id="Mk4"></a>


<sup>4:1</sup> And again he began to teach beside the sea.
And a large crowd was gathered together to him, so-then having stepped onto the ship to sit in the sea,
and all the crowd were [next] to the sea upon the land.
<sup>4:2</sup> And he was teaching them many things in
parables and said to them in his teaching, <sup>4:3</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Listen<span style="font-weight: bold">°:
behold, the sower went forth to sow, <sup>4:4<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">and it
happened, while* he was sowing, some [seed] which
fell beside the road and the birds came and
devoured it. <sup>4:5<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But other [seed] fell upon the rocky-area, where it did not have much earth, and
immediately it rose up, because it had no depth of
earth; <sup>4:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">now [after] <span style="font-weight: bold">the sun rose, it was burnt, and
it dried up because of it has no root. <sup>4:7<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And other
[seed] fell into the thorns, and the thorns shot-up
and choked it, and it gave no fruit. <sup>4:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And other
[seed] fell into the good soil and it was giving fruit,
shooting-up and growing, and it was bringing
[forth] by thirty [times], and by sixty [times], and by a
hundred [times as much.] <sup>4:9</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  And he said, He who
has ears to hear, let him hear.

<sup>4:10</sup> And when he happened [to be] alone, the ones
around him together-with the twelve, asked [about 
]the parable. <sup>4:11</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">It has been
given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God,
but to those, the ones [who are] outside, all things
happen in parables; <sup>4:12</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> in-order-that seeing, they
may see and [yet] may not know, and hearing, they
may hear and [yet] may not understand; lest they
should turn again and [their] sins might be forgiven
them.
<sup>4:13</sup> And he says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Do you° not know this
parable? And how will you° know all the
parables? <sup>4:14</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  The sower is sowing the word. <sup>4:15<span style="font-weight: bold">
</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Now these are the ones beside the road, where the
word is sown, and whenever they hear,
immediately the Adversary comes and takes away
the word which has been sown in their hearts.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>4:16<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And likewise, these are the ones who are
sown upon the rocky-areas, who, whenever they
hear the word, they immediately receive it with
joy; <sup>4:17</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and they have no root in themselves, but
are temporary. Thereafter, [after ]<span style="font-weight: bold">affliction or
persecution happened [to them] because of the
word, immediately they stumble.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>4:18</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And these are the ones who are sown into
the thorns; the ones who hear the word, <sup>4:19<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">and
the anxieties of this age, and the deception of
riches, and the lusts concerning [all] the rest [of the
worldly things] travel into [their hearts], are choking
the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>4:20</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And these are the ones who were sown upon
the good soil; who hear the word and accept [it],
and bear-fruit, by thirty [times] and by sixty [times]
and by a hundred [times].

<sup>4:21</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why not come [with] the
lamp in-order-that it might be placed under a
peck-container or under the bed? No, [you bring it]
in-order-that it might be placed upon the lamp-stand. <sup>4:22<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For* not anything is hidden, which
would not be made manifest, nor [has] [anything]
hidden, happened, but in-order-that it should
come into apparent [view]. <sup>4:23<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">If anyone has ears to
hear, let him hear.
<sup>4:24</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Beware<span style="font-weight: bold">° what you° are
hearing; in what measure, you° measure, it will be
measured to you°, and to you° who hear, [more] will
be added. <sup>4:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* whoever has, to him will be
given, and he who does not have, and what he has
will be taken from him.


<sup>4:26</sup> And he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">So is the kingdom of God, as if
a man cast seed upon the earth; <sup>4:27<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">and he should
sleep and should arise night and day, and the seed
may sprout and should be lengthened, he did not
know how. <sup>4:28</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  For* the earth is bearing-fruit by
herself; first the blade, thereafter the top,
thereafter the full grain in the top.  <sup>4:29</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> But
whenever the fruit gives [way], immediately he
sends forth the sickle, because the harvest is
standing [ready].



<sup>4:30</sup> And he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">To what may be similar to the
kingdom of God? Or in what parable may we put
it [in comparison]? <sup>4:31<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">[It is] like a kernel of a
mustard-seed, which, whenever it should be sown
upon the earth, [though] it is least [compared to] all
the seeds [which are ]upon the earth, <sup>4:32<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">and [yet]
whenever it should be sown, it shoots-up and
becomes greater [than] all the herbs and produces
great branches; so-as [for] the birds of the heaven
to be able to nest under its shadow.

<sup>4:33</sup> And he was speaking the word to them with
many such parables, as they were able to hear it. <sup>4:34</sup>
But he was not speaking to them without a parable,
but privately he was interpreting all things for his
disciples.


{Mar 4:35-41 & Mat:8:18-27 & Luk 8:22-25 Sea of
Galilee.}
<sup>4:35</sup> And [after] it became evening in that day, he
says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">We should go through to the [area]
beyond-that. <sup>4:36</sup> And having left the crowd, they
take him [with them], as he was in the ship. But also
other small-boats were with him. <sup>4:37</sup> And a great gale
of wind happens, and the waves were putting [water]
into the ship, so-as[ for] it now to be filling [with water].
<sup>4:38</sup> And he himself was upon the stern, sleeping upon
the cushion, and they awaken him and say to him,
Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?
<sup>4:39</sup> And having been awakened, he rebuked the
wind, and said to the sea, <span style="font-weight: bold">Be silent. Hush. And the
wind paused and it became a great calm. <sup>4:40</sup> And he
said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why are you° so cowardly? How do
you° not have faith?
<sup>4:41</sup> And they feared [with] a great fear, and were
saying to one another, Who then is this, that even the
wind and the sea are obeying* him?

[Mark 5] <a id="Mk5"></a>


<sup>5:1</sup> And they came to the [area] of the sea beyond-that, into the region of the Gadarenes. <sup>5:2</sup> And he went
forth out-of the ship by himself, immediately a man
encountered him out-of the tombs in [him was] an
unclean spirit, <sup>5:3</sup> who had [his] dwelling in the tombs,
and no one was able to bind him, not even in chains.
<sup>5:4</sup> Because of the same, he had been bound often in
shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn to
shreds by him and the shackles had been crushed,
and no one was strong-enough to tame him. <sup>5:5</sup> And
he was always crying out and cutting himself with
stones, night and day, in the mountains and in the
tombs.

<sup>5:6</sup> Now [after] he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and
worshiped him. <sup>5:7</sup> And having cried out with a loud
voice, he said, What [is this thing] with me and with
you, Jesus, Son of the Highest God? I am imploring
you [by] God, do<span style="font-weight: bold">° not torment me.

<sup>5:8</sup> For* he said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Come forth out-of the
man, [you] unclean spirit. <sup>5:9</sup> And he asked him,
<span style="font-weight: bold">What name [is] <span style="font-weight: bold">in you?
And he answered, saying, Legion [is][ the] name in
me, because we are many. <sup>5:10</sup> And he was pleading
with him much in-order-that he might not send them
forth outside the region. <sup>5:11</sup> Now there was there a
great herd of swine being fed before the mountain.
<sup>5:12</sup> And all the demons pleaded [with] him, saying,
Send us into the swine, in-order-that we may enter
into them. <sup>5:13</sup> And Jesus immediately permitted*
them. And the unclean spirits came forth, and entered
into the swine and the herd rushed down the cliff into
the sea. Now they were approximately two thousand,
and they were choked in the sea.
<sup>5:14</sup> Now the ones feeding the swine fled and
reported [it] to the city and to the rural-areas. And they
came forth to see what it is which has happened. <sup>5:15</sup>
And they come to Jesus and are viewing the one
[previously] being demon-possessed [and] has had the
legion, sitting and having [his] garments on and being
sensible, and they were afraid. <sup>5:16</sup> But the ones who
saw [it] described to them how it happened to the one
[previously] being demon-possessed and concerning
the swine. <sup>5:17</sup> And they began to plead with him to go
away from their borders.

<sup>5:18</sup> And [after] he stepped onto the ship, he who
was demon-possessed was pleading with him in-order-that he may be with him. <sup>5:19</sup> But Jesus did not
allow him, but says to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Proceed away to your
house, to [who are] yours and report to them how-much the Lord did*  for you and [how] he showed-mercy [on] you. <sup>5:20</sup> And he went and began to preach
in Decapolis how-much Jesus did*  for him and all
were marveling.

<sup>5:21</sup> And [after ]Jesus ferried over again in the ship
to the [area] beyond-that, a large crowd was gathered
upon him, and he was beside the sea.


<sup>5:22</sup> And behold one of the rulers of the synagogue,
Jairus by name, comes and having seen him, he falls
toward his feet; <sup>5:23</sup> and was pleading with him much,
saying, My young-daughter is holding on her last
moments. [I pray] that* you might lay [your] hands upon
her [after] you [have] gone [to her], *that she may be
cured and will live. <sup>5:24</sup> And he went with him.

And a large crowd was following him and they
were pressing against him. <sup>5:25</sup> And a certain woman,
being in [her] a flowing of blood [for] twelve years, <sup>5:26</sup>
and [had ]suffered many things under many physicians
and [had ]spent from her things all and was profited
nothing, but rather she came into a worse [condition].
<sup>5:27</sup> Having heard concerning Jesus, she came in the
crowd behind [and] touched his garment. <sup>5:28</sup> For* she
was saying, If-only I touch his garments, I will be
cured. <sup>5:29</sup> And immediately the spring of her blood
was dried up, and she knew that she has been healed
from the disorder in [her] body. <sup>5:30</sup> And immediately
Jesus, having fully known in himself [that] the power
went forth from him [and] having turned [around] in the
crowd, said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Who touched my garments?
<sup>5:31</sup> And his disciples were saying to him, You see
the crowd pressing against you and you say, Who
touched me? <sup>5:32</sup> And he was looking around to see
the one having done*  this thing. <sup>5:33</sup> But the woman
was afraid, trembling, [and] knowing what has
happened upon her, came and fell [down] before him
and spoke all the truth to him.
<sup>5:34</sup> And he said to her, <span style="font-weight: bold">Daughter, your faith has
cured you; proceed away in peace and be healthy
from your disorder.

<sup>5:35</sup> [While] he is still speaking, they come from the
ruler of the synagogue’s [house,] saying, Your
daughter died. Why are you still bothering the
Teacher?
<sup>5:36</sup> But Jesus immediately having heard the word
being spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue,<span style="font-weight: bold"> Do
not fear, only believe. <sup>5:37</sup> And he allowed no one to
follow together-with him, except Peter and James
and John the brother of James. <sup>5:38</sup> And he comes to
the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and he views
an uproar, many weeping and wailing. <sup>5:39</sup> And
having entered, he says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why are you° in an
uproar and weeping? The child has not died, but
is sleeping. <sup>5:40</sup> And they were laughing at him. But
having cast [them] all forth, he takes the father of the
child and the mother and the ones with him and he
travels into where the child was reclining. <sup>5:41</sup> And
having taken-hold of hand of the child, he says to
her, <span style="font-weight: bold">Talitha kumi; which is, [after] being translated,
Girl, I say to you, Lift yourself up! <sup>5:42</sup> And
immediately the girl rose* up and was walking; for*
she was twelve years [old]. And they were astonished
with a great astonishment. <sup>5:43</sup> And he ordered them
much in-order-that no one should know this and he
said [that something is] to be given to her to eat.

[Mark 6] <a id="Mk6"></a>



<sup>6:1</sup> And he went forth from there, and he came into
his fatherland, and his disciples follow him. <sup>6:2</sup> And
[after] it became the Sabbath, he began to teach in the
synagogue. And many hearing him were being
astounded, saying, From where [did] this one [receive]
these things? And what [is] the wisdom which was
given to him? And[ how ]are such miracles happening
through his hands? <sup>6:3</sup> Is this not the carpenter, the
son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Jude
and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And
they were being offended at him.
<sup>6:4</sup> But Jesus said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">A prophet is not
without honor, except in his fatherland and
among [his] relatives and in his house. <sup>6:5</sup> And he
was not able to do* [any] miracle there, except [that] he
laid [his] hands upon a few [who were] sick [and] healed
[them]. <sup>6:6</sup> And he was marveling because of their
unbelief.

{Mar 6:6b-13 & Mat 9:35-10:42 & Luk 9:1-6 Third circuit
of Galilee.}
And he was proceeding around the villages in a
circle, teaching.
<sup>6:7</sup> And he calls the twelve and began to send them
forth two [by] two, and he was giving them authority
[over] the unclean spirits; <sup>6:8</sup> and he commanded them
in-order-that they should take nothing *for the
journey, except only a staff; no knapsack, no bread,
no brass [coins] in the belt; <sup>6:9</sup> but [only] tied on sandals,
also do<span style="font-weight: bold">° not clothe yourselves with two tunics. <sup>6:10</sup>
And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Wherever you° enter into a
house, abide° there until you° should go from
there. <sup>6:11<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">And as many as would not accept you°,
nor may not hear you°, [while] traveling out from
there, shake-off° the dirt which [is] underneath
your° feet *for a testimony to them. Assuredly, I
am saying to you°, It will be more tolerable for
Sodom or Gomorrah in [the] day of judgment than
for that city. <sup>6:12</sup> And they, [the twelve], went forth [and]
were preaching in-order-that they [all] should repent.
<sup>6:13</sup> And they were casting forth many demons and
anointing many with oil [who were] sick and healing
[many].


<sup>6:14</sup> And King Herod heard [of this]; for* his name
became apparent [to him] and he said, John, he who
immerses*, was raised from the dead and because of
this, the[se] powers are working in him.
<sup>6:15</sup> Others were saying, He is Elijah.
But others were saying, He is a prophet, like one
of the prophets [of old.]
<sup>6:16</sup> But having heard [of it], Herod said, John, whom
I beheaded, this one is he; he was raised from the
dead.

<sup>6:17</sup> For* Herod himself [had] sent forth [and] took-hold of John and bound him in prison because of
Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because he [had]
married her. <sup>6:18</sup> For* John said to Herod, “It is not
legal for you to have your brother’s wife.’ <sup>6:19</sup> But
Herodias was holding it against him. And she was
willing to kill him and was not able; <sup>6:20</sup> for* Herod
feared John, knowing him [to be] a righteous and holy
man, and was protecting him. And having heard him,
he was doing*  many things, and was gladly hearing
him, [often].
<sup>6:21</sup> And [when ]it became an opportune day, [along]
with his birthday-festivities, when Herod made* a
supper to his great-men and the commanders, and the
foremost [men] of Galilee; <sup>6:22</sup> and the daughter of
Herodias herself entered and danced, and she pleased
Herod and the ones [who are] reclining [at the meal]
together-with [him]. The king said to the girl, Ask me
whatever you wish and I will be giving it to you. <sup>6:23</sup>
And [after] he had sworn to her, Whatever you might
ask me, I will be giving it to you, insofar as half of
my kingdom.
<sup>6:24</sup> Now she went forth and said to her mother,
What will I ask [for]?
Now she said, The head of John the Immerser*.
<sup>6:25</sup> And she, immediately [and] with diligence,
entered to the king asked, saying, I wish that* you
might give me promptly the head of John the
Immerser* upon a platter.
<sup>6:26</sup> And the king became very sorrowful because
of the oaths [he said] and the ones [who are] reclining [at
the meal] together-with [him], he did not wish to reject
her. <sup>6:27</sup> And the king immediately sent forth an
executioner [and] commanded his head to be brought.
<sup>6:28</sup> Now he went and beheaded him in the prison, and
carried his head upon a platter and gave it to the girl,
and the girl gave it to her mother. <sup>6:29</sup> And having
heard [of it], his disciples came and lifted up his corpse
and placed it in a tomb.

{Mar 6:30-32 & Mat 14:13 & Luk 9:10 & Joh 6:1 East
shore of Galilee.}
<sup>6:30</sup> And the apostles are gathered together-with
Jesus, and they reported to him all things, both how-much they [had] done* and how-much they [had] taught.
<sup>6:31</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">You° yourselves come-here<span style="font-weight: bold">°
privately into a desolate place and rest° yourselves
a few. For* the ones coming and the ones proceeding
away were many and they were not having an
opportunity to eat. <sup>6:32</sup> And they went away into a
desolate place in the ship privately.


<sup>6:33</sup> And they saw them proceeding away and many
recognized him and they ran together there on-foot
from all of the cities and went before them, and came
together to him. <sup>6:34</sup> And Jesus went forth, [and] saw a
large crowd and he had compassion upon them,
because they were like sheep not having a shepherd
and he began to teach them many things.
<sup>6:35</sup> And [after] it already became a late hour, his
disciples came near to him [and] are saying, The place
is desolate and already [it is] a late hour; <sup>6:36</sup> dismiss
them, in-order-that they might buy bread for
themselves, [after] they [have] gone into the circle [of the
]rural-areas and villages, for* they do not have what
they might eat .
<sup>6:37</sup> But he answered [and ]said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">You°<span style="font-weight: bold">, give<span style="font-weight: bold">°
them [something] to eat.
And they say to him, [After] we [have] gone away,
should we buy two hundred denarii [worth] of loaves,
and we might give them [that] to eat?
<sup>6:38</sup> Now he says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">How-many loaves do
you° have? Proceed<span style="font-weight: bold">° away and see°.
And [after] they knew, they say, Five and two fish.
<sup>6:39</sup> And he commanded them all to recline [in] groups;
[all the  ]groups upon the pale-green grass. <sup>6:40</sup> And
they leaned-back [in] rows [of] a hundred apiece and
rows [of] fifty apiece. <sup>6:41</sup> And he took the five loaves
and the two fish, [and] looked up to heaven, he gave-thanks and broke the loaves. And he was giving [them]
to his disciples in-order-that they might place [the
bread] beside them, and he divided the two fish to all.
<sup>6:42</sup> And they all ate and were fully-fed. <sup>6:43</sup> And they
took up twelve full baskets of broken pieces and [also]
from the fish. <sup>6:44</sup> And the ones who ate the loaves
were five thousand men. 


<sup>6:45</sup> And immediately he urged his disciples to step
onto the ship, and to precede [him] to the [area] beyond-that into Bethsaida, until he should dismiss the
crowd. <sup>6:46</sup> And having bid farewell to them, he went
away into the mountain to pray.
<sup>6:47</sup> And [after] it became evening, the ship was in
the middle of the sea and he [was] alone upon the land.
<sup>6:48</sup> And he saw them tormented in the[ir] rowing, for*
the wind was adverse to them, and he comes to them
around the fourth watch of the night, walking upon
the sea, and he was willing to pass over them. <sup>6:49</sup> But
[after] they saw him walking upon the sea, they
thought [it] to be an apparition and cried out; <sup>6:50</sup> for*
they all saw him and were disturbed. And
immediately, he spoke with them, and says to them,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Have°<span style="font-weight: bold"> courage. I am [here]. Do° not be afraid. <sup>6:51</sup>
And he went-up to them into the ship, and the wind
paused, and they were exceedingly, exceptionally,
astonished in themselves and marveled! <sup>6:52</sup> For* they
did not understand [what happened] upon the loaves,
for* their heart was hardening. <sup>6:53</sup> And having ferried
over, they came upon the land of Gennesaret and they
were anchored [there], <sup>6:54</sup> and they themselves gone
forth out-of the ship, immediately [the people]
recognized him.

<sup>6:55</sup> Having ran around that whole region around
[there], they began to carry around the ones having an
ill[ness] upon the[ir] pallets, where they were hearing:
he is [over] there. <sup>6:56</sup> And wherever he was traveling,
[if] into villages or cities or the rural-areas, they were
laying the sick in the marketplaces and were pleading
with him, in-order-that if-only they might touch the
hem of his garment, and as many as would touch him
were being cured.

{Mar 7:1-23 & Mat 15:1-20 & Joh 7:1 Galilee, probably
Capernaum Spring 29 AD.}
<sup>7:1</sup> And the Pharisees and some of the scribes are
gathered together to [see] him, [after] they came from
Jerusalem, <sup>7:2</sup> and having seen some of his disciples
eating [their] bread with common, this is: unwashed
hands; they found-fault. <sup>7:3</sup> For* the Pharisees and all
the Jews, if they do not wash the[ir] hands [scrubbing]
with [the] fist, do not eat, holding-fast the tradition of
the elders; <sup>7:4</sup> and [when coming] from the marketplace,
they do not eat if they [have] not immersed* 
themselves [first], and there are many other things
which they took to holding-fast, [like] immersions* {Or,
[O.T. ]ceremonial washings} of cups and pint pitchers and
brass kettles and cots. <sup>7:5</sup> Thereafter, the Pharisees
and the scribes ask him, Why are your disciples not
walking according-to the tradition of the elders, but
eat the[ir] bread with unwashed hands?
<sup>7:6</sup> But he answered [and ]said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Isaiah
prophesied well concerning you° hypocrites, as it
has been written, “This people are honoring me
with the[ir] lips, but their heart is distant, faraway
from me. <sup>7:7<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">But they are worshiping me in futility,
teaching [as their] teachings the commandments of
men.’  <sup>7:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* [after] you° <span style="font-weight: bold">left the
commandment of God, you° are holding-fast the
tradition of men, [like] <span style="font-weight: bold">immersions* of pint pitchers
and cups, and you° practice many other such
similar things.
<sup>7:9</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">You° reject well <span style="font-weight: bold">the
commandment of God, in-order-that you° might
keep your° tradition. <sup>7:10<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For* Moses said, “Honor
your father and your mother.’ {Exo 20:12 & Deu
5:16} <span style="font-weight: bold">And, “He who is speaking evil of father or
mother, let him be ended [by the sentence of] death.’
 <sup>7:11</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But you° say, If a man says
to [his] father or [his]<span style="font-weight: bold"> mother, Whatever you might
be profited from me is Corban, (what is a gift). <sup>7:12</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">And [so] you° no longer allow him to do*<span style="font-weight: bold"> anything
for his father or for his mother,  <sup>7:13</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">invalidating
the word of God (which you° gave up<span style="font-weight: bold">) by your°
tradition, and you° practice many such similar
things.
<sup>7:14</sup> And having called all the crowd, he said to
them, <span style="font-weight: bold">All, hear<span style="font-weight: bold">° me and understand°. <sup>7:15</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  There is
nothing outside the man, which traveling into him
is able to desecrate him, but the things which
travel out from him, those are the things which
desecrate the man. <sup>7:16<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">If anyone has ears to hear,
let him hear.

<sup>7:17</sup> And when he entered into the house away from
the crowd, his disciples asked him concerning the
parable. <sup>7:18</sup> And he says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">So are you° also
without understanding? Are you° not perceiving,
that everything outside which travels into the
man, is not able to desecrate him; <sup>7:19</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">because it is
not traveling into the heart, but into the belly and
travels into the sewer? ([He said thus,] cleansing all
foods.) <sup>7:20</sup> Now he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">What travels out from the
man, this desecrates the man. <sup>7:21<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For* evil
reasonings travel from inside, out-of the heart of
men, [such as]: adulteries, fornications, murders,
<sup>7:22<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">thefts, greedy-acts, wickednesses, treachery,
unbridled-lust, an evil eye, blasphemy,
haughtiness, foolishness. <sup>7:23<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">All these evil things
travel out [from] inside, and desecrate the man.


<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>7:24</sup> And he stood up [and] went away from there,
into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered
into a house [and] wished no one to know [it], and he
was not able to elude [them].


<sup>7:25</sup> For* a woman, having heard [things] concerning
him, (whose young-daughter herself was holding an
unclean spirit), came [and] fell [down] before his feet.
<sup>7:26</sup> Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician
by birth. And she was asking of him in-order-that he
might cast forth the demon out-of her daughter. <sup>7:27</sup>
But Jesus said to her, <span style="font-weight: bold">Allow the children first to be
fully-fed; for* it is not good to take the children’s
bread and cast it to the puppies.
<sup>7:28</sup> But she answered, and says to him, Yes, Lord;
for* even the puppies underneath the table eat from
the children’s crumbs.
<sup>7:29</sup> And he said to her, <span style="font-weight: bold">Because of this, the
speech, proceed away; the demon has gone forth
out-of your daughter. <sup>7:30</sup> And she went away to her
house and found the daughter [of her] had been put
upon a cot, the demon having gone forth.


<sup>7:31</sup> And again, having gone forth from the borders
of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee,
between the borders of Decapolis.

{Mar 7:32-37 & Mat 15:30-31 Magadan and Bethsaida
Summer 29 AD.}
<sup>7:32</sup> And they bring to him a speaking impaired
deaf [man] and they are pleading with him in-order-that he might lay his hand upon him. <sup>7:33</sup> And having
taken him away from the crowd privately, he put his
fingers into his ears, and he spat, [and] touched his
tongue. <sup>7:34</sup> And having looked up to heaven, he
groaned and says to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Ephphatha; (which is, Be
opened). <sup>7:35</sup> And immediately his ears were opened,
and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he was
speaking correctly. <sup>7:36</sup> And he ordered them in-order-that they should tell no one, but as many things as he
was ordering them [not to tell], rather, they were
preaching [it] even-more.
<sup>7:37</sup> And they were being abundantly astounded,
saying, He has done* all things well; he makes* even
the deaf to hear, and the mute to speak.

[Mark 8] <a id="Mk8"></a>


<sup>8:1</sup> The crowd being enormous in those days, and
they do not have what they might eat {i.e. they have
nothing to eat}. Jesus, having called to him his
disciples, says to them, <sup>8:2</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">I have compassion upon
the crowd, because they already remain with me
[for] three days and do not have what they might
eat. <sup>8:3</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  And if I dismiss them starving to their
house, they will faint on the road; for* some of
them are coming from far [away].
<sup>8:4</sup> And his disciples answered him, From where
will anyone be able to fully-feed these [men] bread
here in the wilderness?
<sup>8:5</sup> And he asked them, <span style="font-weight: bold">How-many loaves do you°
have?
Now they said, Seven.
<sup>8:6</sup> And he commanded the crowd to lean-back
upon the soil. And he took the seven loaves, [and]
having given-thanks, he broke [them] and was giving
[them] to his disciples, in-order-that they might place
[them] beside [them], and they placed [them] beside the
crowd. <sup>8:7</sup> And they were holding a few small-fish,
and having given-thanks, he said [to his disciples] to
also place [these] beside them. <sup>8:8</sup> Now they ate and
were fully-fed, and they took up abundances of
broken pieces, seven baskets. <sup>8:9</sup> Now the ones who
ate were approximately four thousand, and he
dismissed them.

{Mar 8:10-26 & Mat 15:39-16:12 Near Caesarea Philippi
Summer 29 AD.}
<sup>8:10</sup> And immediately he stepped into the ship with
his disciples [and] came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

<sup>8:11</sup> And the Pharisees came forth and began to
debate together-with him, seeking from him a sign
from the heaven, testing him. <sup>8:12</sup> And having groaned
deeply in his spirit, he says, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why is this generation
seeking a sign?<span style="font-weight: bold"> Assuredly I am saying to you°, [As]
if a sign will be given to this generation. <sup>8:13</sup> And
having left them, he again stepped onto a ship, [and]
went away to the [area] beyond-that.

<sup>8:14</sup> And they forgot to take bread, and they did not
have [any bread,] except one loaf in the ship with
themselves. <sup>8:15</sup> And he ordered them, saying,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Behold<span style="font-weight: bold">° [and] beware° [stay] away from the leaven of
the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.
<sup>8:16</sup> And they were reasoning with one another,
saying, [It is] because we have no bread.

are you° reasoning [so], because you° have no
bread? Do you° not yet perceive, nor understand?
Do you° still have your° heart hardened? <sup>8:18<span style="font-weight: bold">

<sup>8:22</sup> And he comes to Bethsaida. And they bring to
him a blind [man] and they are pleading with him in-order-that he might touch him. <sup>8:23</sup> And having
grabbed the hand of the blind [man], he led him
outside the village, and having spat into his eyes, he
laid his hands upon him, he asked him if he sees
anything.
<sup>8:24</sup> And having looked up, he said, I see men,
because I see [them] like walking trees. <sup>8:25</sup> Thereafter
he laid [his] hands upon his eyes again, and he made*
him to look at [him]. And he was restored and looked
at everyone distinctly.
<sup>8:26</sup> And he sent him forth to his house, saying,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Neither enter into the village, nor say [anything] to
anyone in the village.

{Mar 8:27-30 & Mat 16:13-20 & Luk 9:18-21 Caesarea
Philippi.}
<sup>8:27</sup> And Jesus went forth and his disciples, into the
villages of Caesarea Philippi, and on the road he
asked his disciples, saying to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Who do men say
me to be <span style="font-weight: bold">?
<sup>8:28</sup> Now they answered, John the Immerser* and
others, Elijah, but others, One of the prophets.

<sup>8:29</sup> And he says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">But who do you° say me
to be <span style="font-weight: bold">?
Now Peter answered, saying to him, You are the
Christ. <sup>8:30</sup> And he rebuked them in-order-that they
should speak to no one concerning him.

{Mar 8:31-9:1 & Mat 16:21-28 & Luk 9:22-27 Caesarea
Philippi.}
<sup>8:31</sup> And he began to teach them, that it is essential
[for] the Son of Man to suffer many things and to be
rejected* from the elders and the high-priests and the
scribes, and be killed, and to rise* up after three days.
<sup>8:32</sup> And he was speaking the word frankly. And Peter
took him [and] began to rebuke him. <sup>8:33</sup> But he turned
again, and saw his disciples, [and] rebuked Peter,
saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">Proceed away, behind me, adversary,
because you are not mindful of the things of God,
but the things of men.
<sup>8:34</sup> And having called the crowd together-with his
disciples to him, he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Who[ever] wishes to
follow after me, let him deny himself, and lift up
his cross and follow me. <sup>8:35<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For* whoever wishes to
save his life will be losing it, and whoever should
lose his life because of me and [because] of the
good-news, this one will be saving it. <sup>8:36</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* what
will it profit a man, if he should gain the whole
world and his soul should be forfeited? <sup>8:37</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Or
what will a man give [as ]an exchange [for] his soul?
<sup>8:38</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* whoever is ashamed of me and of my
words in this generation, the adulteress and
sinner, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of
him, whenever he comes in the glory of his Father
with the holy messengers. [Mark 9]<a id="Mk9"></a>  <sup>9:1</sup> And he
was saying to them,<span style="font-weight: bold"> <span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I am saying to you°,
There are some of the ones standing here, who
should never taste of death, until they should see
the kingdom of God having come in power.

{Mar 9:2-13 & Mat 17:1-13 & Luk 9:28-36 Caesarea
Philippi.}
<sup>9:2</sup> And after six days Jesus takes with [him] Peter
and James and John and brings them [up] alone into a
high mountain privately, and he was transfigured
before them; <sup>9:3</sup> and his garments became gleaming,
exceedingly white like snow, such-as no launderer
upon the earth is able to whiten. <sup>9:4</sup> And Elijah,
together-with Moses, was seen by them, and they
were speaking together-with Jesus.
<sup>9:5</sup> And Peter answered [and] says to Jesus, Rabbi,
it is good [for] us to be here, and we should make*
three tabernacles; one to you and one to Moses and
one to Elijah. <sup>9:6</sup> For* he did not know what he will
 say; for* they were fearful.
<sup>9:7</sup> And it happened [that] a cloud overshadowing
them, and a voice came out-of the cloud, <span style="font-weight: bold">This is my
beloved Son; hear<span style="font-weight: bold">° him! <sup>9:8</sup> And suddenly, having
looked around, they saw no one anymore, but only
Jesus with themselves.

<sup>9:9</sup> Now [while] coming-down from the mountain,
he ordered them in-order-that they should describe to
no one what they saw, except whenever the Son of
Man rises* up from the dead. <sup>9:10</sup> And they took-hold
of the word for themselves, debating together-with
[themselves], What is the thing, to rise* up from the
dead? <sup>9:11</sup> And they asked him, saying, [How is it] that
the scribes say that it is essential [for] Elijah to come
first?
<sup>9:12</sup> But he answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Elijah
indeed came first, and restores all things, and how
it has been written of the Son of Man, in-order-that he should suffer many things and should be
scorned, <sup>9:13</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But I am saying to you°, that Elijah
has come, and they also did*  to him as many
things as they wished, just-as it has been written
upon the [basis of] him.

{Mar 9:14-29 & Mat 17:14-21 & Luk 9:37-43 Region of
Caesarea Philippi.}
<sup>9:14</sup> And [after] he came [back] to the disciples, they
saw a large crowd around them and scribes debating
together-with them. <sup>9:15</sup> And immediately all the
crowd, having seen him, were utterly amazed, and
running up to [him], they were greeting him. <sup>9:16</sup> And
he asked the scribes,<span style="font-weight: bold">  What are you° debating
together with them?
<sup>9:17</sup> And one out-of the crowd answered [and] said,
Teacher, I brought my son to you, who has a mute
spirit; <sup>9:18</sup> and wherever it overtakes him, it rips [at]
him and he foams and grinds his teeth and he is dried
up, and I spoke to your disciples in-order-that they
might cast it out, and [yet] they were not strong-enough.
<sup>9:19</sup> But he answered [and] says, <span style="font-weight: bold">O unbelieving
generation, until when will I be with you°? Until
when will I tolerate you°? Bring<span style="font-weight: bold">° him to me. <sup>9:20</sup>
And they brought him to him, and [after] having seen
him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he
fell upon the earth. He was wallowing, foaming. <sup>9:21</sup>
Now he asked his father, <span style="font-weight: bold">How-much time is it [that
things] like this has happened to him?
<span style="font-weight: bold">And he said, From childhood. <sup>9:22</sup> And often it [has]
cast him both into fire and into waters, in-order-that
it might destroy him, but if you are able [to do]
anything, help us and have compassion upon us.
<sup>9:23</sup> Now Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">If you are able to
believe. All things [are] possible to the one
believing.
<sup>9:24</sup> And immediately the father of the child cried
out with tears [and] said, I believe; Lord, help [me] with
my unbelief.
<sup>9:25</sup> Now [after] Jesus saw that a crowd is running
together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him,
<span style="font-weight: bold">I command you, the mute and deaf spirit, come
forth out-of him and enter into him no longer.
<sup>9:26</sup> And having cried out and having convulsed
him much, it came forth, and [the boy] became like [one]
dead; so-then [for] many to say, He died.
<sup>9:27</sup> But having taken-hold of the hand [of him],
Jesus lifted him up, and he stood up. <sup>9:28</sup> And having
entered into the house, his disciples asked him
privately, [How is it] that we were not able to cast it
forth?
<sup>9:29</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">This variety is not able
to come forth with* anything, except in prayer
and fasting.

{Mar 9:30-32 & Mat 17:22-23 & Luk 9:43-45 Return to
Galilee.}
<sup>9:30</sup> And they went forth from there, [and] were
traveling through Galilee, and he did not wish that*
anyone should know [it]. <sup>9:31</sup> For* he was teaching his
disciples and was saying to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">The Son of Man
is [to be] given up into the hands of men, and they
will be killing him, and having been killed, he will
be rising* in the third day. <sup>9:32</sup> But they were not
considering the declaration, and were afraid to ask
him.



<sup>9:33</sup> And he came into Capernaum, and [after] he
came* in[to] the house he asked them, <span style="font-weight: bold">What were you°
reasoning with yourselves on the road<span style="font-weight: bold">? <sup>9:34</sup> But
they were silent; for* they [had] reasoned with one
another on the road, who [was] greater. <sup>9:35</sup> And having
sat [down], he summoned the twelve, and he says to
them, <span style="font-weight: bold">If anyone wishes to be first, he will be last of
all and servant of all. <sup>9:36</sup> And having taken a [young]
child, he stood it in the midst of them. And having
wrapped it in [his] arms, he said to them, <sup>9:37</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Whoever
accepts one of such children in my name, accepts
me, and whoever accepts me, does not accept me,
but the one who sent me.

<sup>9:38</sup> Now John answered him, saying, Teacher, we
saw someone casting forth demons in your name,
who is not following us, and we forbade him because
he is not following us.
<sup>9:39</sup> But Jesus said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Do<span style="font-weight: bold">° not forbid him; for* there
is no one who will be doing*  a miracle in my
name, and be able to speak evil of me quickly. <sup>9:40</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">For* he who is not against you° is [working] on your°<span style="font-weight: bold">
behalf. <sup>9:41</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* whoever delivers [to] you° a cup of
water to drink in my name, because you° are of
Christ,<span style="font-weight: bold"> assuredly I am saying to you°, He should
never lose his reward. <sup>9:42</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And whoever offends
one of the[se] little [ones] who believe in me, it is
good for him rather if a mill’s stone encompassed
around his neck, and he has been cast into the sea.
<sup>9:43</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And if your hand offends you, cut it off. It
is good for you to enter into life crippled, [rather]
than having the two hands, [and] to go into hell,
into the unquenchable fire, <sup>9:44</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">where a maggot of
them does not die* and the fire is not quenched. <sup></sup>
<sup>9:45</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And if your foot offends you, cut it off. It is
good for you to enter into life lame, [rather] than

does not die* and the fire is not quenched. <sup></sup>
<sup>9:47</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And if your eye offends you, cast it forth. It

<sup>10:1</sup> And having risen* up from there, he goes into
the borders of Judea through the [area] beyond-that of
the Jordan, and crowds travel together to him again.
And as he had been accustomed, he was teaching
them again. <sup>10:2</sup> And the Pharisees came near [and]
asked him, testing him, If it is [not] legal for a man to
divorce [his] wife, [then]?
<sup>10:3</sup> But he answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">What did
Moses command you°?
<sup>10:4</sup> But they said, Moses permitted<span style="font-weight: bold">* [us] to write a
document of divorcement and to divorce. 
<sup>10:5</sup> And Jesus answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">He
wrote this commandment for you°, for your°
hardness of heart. <sup>10:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But “God made*<span style="font-weight: bold"> them male
and female’ from [the] beginning of the creation.
 <sup>10:7</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">“Because of this, a man will be
leaving his father and mother and will be joined
to his wife; <sup>10:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and the two will be into <span style="font-weight: bold">
one flesh,’ so-then they are no more two, but one
flesh. <span style="font-weight: bold"> <sup>10:9</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, what God yoked
together, let man not separate.
<sup>10:10</sup> And his disciples in the house asked him
again concerning the same thing. <sup>10:11</sup> And he says to
them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Whoever divorces his wife and should
marry another is committing adultery against
her; <sup>10:12</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and if a woman divorces her husband
and should be married another, she is committing
adultery.


<sup>10:13</sup> And they were bringing to him [young]
children, in-order-that he might touch them, but the
disciples were rebuking the ones bringing [them]. <sup>10:14</sup>
But [after] Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to
them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Allow<span style="font-weight: bold">° the [young] children to come to me,
and do° not forbid them; for* the kingdom of God
is of such. <sup>10:15</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> <span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I am saying to you°,
Whoever does not accept the kingdom of God like
a [young] child, he should never enter into it. <sup>10:16</sup>
And having wrapped them in [his] arms, [and] laying his
hands upon them, he was blessing them.

{Mar 10:17-31 & Mat 19:16-20:16 & Luk 18:18-30
Peraea.}
<sup>10:17</sup> And [while] traveling toward [the] road, one ran
up to him [and] knelt [before] him, and asked him, Good
Teacher, what should I practice in-order-that I may
inherit everlasting life?
<sup>10:18</sup> But Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why do you call<span style="font-weight: bold">* me
good? None [is] good except one, [our] God. <sup>10:19</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You
know the commandments: “Do not commit
adultery. Do not murder. Do not steal. Do not
falsely testify. Do not defraud. Honor your father
and mother.’ 
<sup>10:20</sup> But he answered [and] said to him, Teacher, I
[have] observed all these things from my youth.
<sup>10:21</sup> Now Jesus, having looked at him, loved* him,
and said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">You are lacking [in] one thing.
Proceed away, sell as many things as you have
and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in
heaven. And come-here, follow me, having lifted
up the cross. <sup>10:22</sup> But he was dismal upon the word,
[and] went away, being sorrowful; for* he has many
properties.

<sup>10:23</sup> And Jesus, having looked around, says to his
disciples, <span style="font-weight: bold">How the ones who have wealth will
hardly enter into the kingdom of God! <sup>10:24</sup> Now
the disciples were being amazed upon his words. But
Jesus again answered [and] says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Children,
how hard it is [for] the ones who have confidence in
wealth to enter into the kingdom of God! <sup>10:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">It is
easier [for] a camel to enter through a needle’s eye,
than [for] a rich [man] to enter into the kingdom of
God.
<sup>10:26</sup> Now they were being astounded even-more
with themselves, saying [to him], And who is able to
be saved?
<sup>10:27</sup> But Jesus, having looked at them, says, <span style="font-weight: bold">[It is]
impossible with men<span style="font-weight: bold">, but not with God; for* all
things are possible with God.
<sup>10:28</sup> Peter began to say to him, Behold, we left all
and followed you.
<sup>10:29</sup> Jesus answered [and] said,<span style="font-weight: bold"> <span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I am
saying to you°, There is no one who [has] left [his]
house or brethren or sisters or father or mother

<sup>10:32</sup> Now they were on the road, going-up to
Jerusalem, and Jesus was leading them and they were
being amazed, and following, were afraid. And he
took again the twelve, and began to tell them the
things [which are] about to befall him, <sup>10:33</sup> [saying],
<span style="font-weight: bold">Behold, we are going-up to Jerusalem, and the
Son of Man will be given up to the high-priests
and scribes, and they will be condemning him to
death and will be giving him up to the Gentiles,
<sup>10:34</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and they will be mocking him and will be
scourging him and will be spitting on him and will
be killing him, and he will rise* up in the third

<sup>10:35</sup> And James and John, the sons of Zebedee,
travel before him, saying, Teacher, we wish that*
whatever we ask, you might do* [it] for us.
<sup>10:36</sup> But he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">What are you° wishing
me to do*<span style="font-weight: bold"> for you°?
<sup>10:37</sup> Now they said to him, Give to us that* we may
sit, one at your right [hand] and one at your left [hand]
in your glory.
<sup>10:38</sup> But Jesus said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">You° do not know
what you° are asking for yourselves. Are you° able
to drink the cup which I am drinking? And to be
immersed* [in] the immersion*<span style="font-weight: bold"> which I am
immersed* [in]?
<sup>10:39</sup> Now they said to him, We are able.
But Jesus said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Indeed the cup which I
am drinking, you° will be drinking, and the
immersion*<span style="font-weight: bold"> which I am immersed* [in], you° will be
immersed* [in]. <sup>10:40</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But to sit at my right and at [my]
left is not mine to give, but [it is for them] for whom
it has been prepared. <sup>10:41</sup> And having heard [it], the
ten began to be indignant concerning James and
John.

<sup>10:42</sup> Now having called them, Jesus says to them,
<span style="font-weight: bold">You° know that the ones who seem to rule over the
Gentiles are lording it over them, and their great
ones are wielding authority over them. <sup>10:43</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But it
will not be so among you°, but [rather,] whoever
wishes to become great among you° will be your°
servant; <sup>10:44</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and whoever may wish to become
first: he you° will be bondservant of all. <sup>10:45</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For*
the Son of Man also came, not to be served, but to
serve, and to give his life [as] a redemption in

<sup>10:46</sup> And they come into Jericho, and [while]
traveling from Jericho [with] his disciples and a
considerable crowd, Bartimaeus, the blind son of
Timaeus, was sitting [and] begging beside the road.
<sup>10:47</sup> And having heard that it is Jesus the Nazarene,
he began to cry out and say, Jesus, son of David,
show-mercy [on] me. <sup>10:48</sup> And many were rebuking
him, in-order-that he should be silent, but he was
crying out much more, Son of David, show-mercy to
me.
<sup>10:49</sup> And Jesus stood [still and] said [for] him to be
summoned.
And they summon the blind [man], saying to him,
Have courage. Lift yourself up! He is summoning
you. <sup>10:50</sup> Now he came to Jesus, having cast away his
garment, [and] having stood up.
<sup>10:51</sup> And Jesus answered [and] says to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">What
do you wish [that] I might do*<span style="font-weight: bold"> for you?
Now the blind [man] said to him, Rabboni, that* I
may recover [my] sight.
<sup>10:52</sup> Now Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Proceed away; your
faith has cured you. And immediately he recovered
his sight and was following Jesus on the road.

saying to them, What are you° doing*, loosening the
young-donkey?
<sup>11:6</sup> And they said to them just-as Jesus
commanded and they allowed them. <sup>11:7</sup> And they led
the young-donkey to Jesus and cast their garments
upon it, and he sat upon it. <sup>11:8</sup> But many spread their
garments onto the road, and others were cutting
leafage from the trees and were spreading [them] in the
road. <sup>11:9</sup> And the ones who precede [him] and the ones

<sup>11:15</sup> And they come to Jerusalem [and] Jesus entered
into the temple and began to cast forth the ones [who

the tables of the brokers and the chairs of the ones
[who are ]selling the doves; <sup>11:16</sup> and he was not
allowing, that* anyone should carry goods through
the temple. <sup>11:17</sup> And he was teaching [them], saying to
them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Has it not been written, “My house will be
called a house of prayer for all the nations? But
you° made*<span style="font-weight: bold"> it a den of robbers.’

up from the roots. <sup>11:21</sup> And Peter, having
remembered, says to him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree

 {Mar 12:1-12 & Mat 21:33-46 & Luk
20:9-19.}
<sup>12:1</sup> And he began to speak to them in parables: <span style="font-weight: bold">A
man planted a vineyard and placed a fence
around it and shoveled a winepress [in it] and built
a tower, and rented it out to farmers and went-abroad. <sup>12:2</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And in the [harvest] time, he sent a
bondservant to the farmers, in-order-that he
might receive from the fruit of the vineyard from
the farmers. <sup>12:3</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But they took him and whipped
[him] and sent [him] forth empty [handed]. <sup>12:4</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And
again, he sent another bondservant to them, and
having stoned [him], they bashed his head and sent
[him] forth, having dishonored [him]. <sup>12:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And again,
he sent another, and they killed [him] and many
others, whipping some but killing [some]. <sup>12:6</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, he still has one, his beloved son; he
also sent him last to them, saying, They will revere
my son. <sup>12:7</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But those farmers said to themselves,
This is the heir. Come-here<span style="font-weight: bold">°. We should kill him
and the inheritance will be ours. <sup>12:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And they took
him [and] killed [him] and cast [him] forth outside the
vineyard. <sup>12:9</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, what will the lord of the
vineyard be doing* ? He will come and will be
destroying the farmers and will be giving the
vineyard to others. <sup>12:10</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Did you° not even read this
Scripture, “The stone which the builders rejected*,
this one became to [them] the head of the corner;
<sup>12:11</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">this came*<span style="font-weight: bold"> from the Lord and it is marvelous
in our eyes’?  <sup>12:12</sup> And they were
seeking to take-hold of him, and [yet] they feared the
crowd. For* they knew that he spoke the parable to
them and they left him [and] went away.

 {Mar 12:13-17 & Mat 22:15-22 & Luk
20:20-26 Courtyard of the Temple, Tues.}
<sup>12:13</sup> And they send to him some of the Pharisees
and [some] of the Herodians, in-order-that they might
catch him in [his] speech. <sup>12:14</sup> Now [after] they came,
they say to him, Teacher, we know that you are true*
and do not care concerning one[’s appearance]. For*
you do not look at [the] countenance of men, but teach
the way of God in truth. Is it legal to give tribute to
Caesar or not? <sup>12:15</sup> Should we give or should we not
give?
But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Why are you° testing me? Bring<span style="font-weight: bold">° me a denarius {a
standard day’s pay}<span style="font-weight: bold">, in-order-that I may see it. <sup>12:16</sup>
Now they brought it. And he says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Whose
[face] is this image and inscription?
<span style="font-weight: bold">Now they said to him, Caesar’s.
<sup>12:17</sup> And Jesus answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Give<span style="font-weight: bold">°
to Caesar the things [which are] Caesar’s and [give]
to God the things [which are] God’s. And they
marveled at him.


<sup>12:18</sup> And [the] Sadducees come to him, who are
saying,  [There is] to be no resurrection, and they asked
him, saying, <sup>12:19</sup> Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If
anyone’s brother should die and he should leave a
wife [alone] and he should leave no children, that* his
brother should take his wife and should raise* up seed
to his brother.  <sup>12:20</sup> Seven brothers were
[with us] and the first took a wife and dying left no
seed; <sup>12:21</sup> and the second took her and died, and not
even he himself left seed, and the third likewise*; <sup>12:22</sup>
and the seven took her and left no seed. Last of all
the woman also died. <sup>12:23</sup>  Whenever they rise* up in
the resurrection, whose wife will she be of them?
For* the seven had her [as their] wife.
<sup>12:24</sup> And Jesus answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Are
you° not [being] misled because of this, [by] not
knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God?
<sup>12:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* whenever they rise* up from the dead,
they neither marry, nor are they betrothed, but
are like messengers the ones in the heavens. <sup>12:26</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">But concerning the dead, that they are raised; did
you° not read in the book of Moses, How God
spoke to him at the bush<span style="font-weight: bold">, saying, “I [am] the God of
Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of
Jacob'?  <sup>12:27</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">He is not [the] God of [the] dead,
but [the] God [of the] living. Therefore, you° are [very]
much misled.


<sup>12:28</sup> And one of the scribes came near [and] heard
them debating together, [and] knowing that he [had]
answered them well, asked him, What commandment
is the first of all?
<sup>12:29</sup> But Jesus answered him, <span style="font-weight: bold">The first of all the
commandments is: “Hear, [O] Israel; The Lord our
God, the Lord is one'; <sup>12:30</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and “You will love* the
Lord your God from  your whole heart and from
your whole soul and from your whole mind and
from your whole strength.’ This [is] the first
commandment.  <sup>12:31</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And the second one
[is] similar [to] this one: “You will love* your
neighbor like yourself.’ There is no other
commandment greater [than] <span style="font-weight: bold">these. 
<sup>12:32</sup> And the scribe said to him, Teacher, you said
well in truth, that he is one, and there is not another
other-than him; <sup>12:33</sup> and to love* him from the whole
heart and from the whole intelligence and from the
whole soul and from the whole strength and to love*
the neighbor, [he has,] like himself, is more-than all
[the] whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.


<sup>12:34</sup> And [after] Jesus saw that he answered with
perception, he said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">You are not far from the
kingdom of God. And no one was daring [enough] to
ask him anymore.


<sup>12:35</sup> And Jesus answered [and] said, [while] teaching
in the temple, <span style="font-weight: bold">How [is it that] the scribes say that the
Christ is the son of David? <sup>12:36</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For*<span style="font-weight: bold"> David himself
said in [the] Holy Spirit, “The Lord says to my
Lord, Sit at my right [hand], until I should place
your enemies [as the]  footstool of your feet.’ {Psa
110:1} <sup>12:37</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore David himself calls<span style="font-weight: bold">* him
Lord, and from where is he his son? And the large
crowd was gladly hearing him.

{Mar 12:38-40 & Mat 23:1-39 & Luk 20:45-47 Courts of
the Temple, Tues.}
<sup>12:38</sup> And he said to them in his teaching, <span style="font-weight: bold">Beware<span style="font-weight: bold">°
[of things] from the scribes, who wish to walk in
[long] robes and [to have] greetings in the
marketplaces, <sup>12:39</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and [the] foremost seats in the
synagogues and foremost-places at the suppers.
<sup>12:40</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">[They are] the ones who devour widows’ houses
and [the ones] praying long [prayers] for a pretext;
these will be receiving even-more condemnation.

{Mar 12:41-44 & Luk 21:1-4 In the Temple Treasury,
Tues.}
<sup>12:41</sup> And having sat [down] opposite the treasury,
Jesus was viewing how the crowd cast brass [coins]
into the treasury, and many [who were] rich were
casting [in] much. <sup>12:42</sup> And one poor widow came [and]
she cast [in] two bronze-coins, which is [equal to] a
copper-coin. <sup>12:43</sup> And having called his disciples to
him, he says to them,<span style="font-weight: bold"> <span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I am saying to
you°, This poor widow has cast in more-than all
the ones casting [in much] into the treasury; <sup>12:44</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">for* they all cast [in] out-of the thing abounding to
them, but this one cast [in], out-of her lack [of] all
things, as many things as she had, her whole
livelihood.

of stones and what sort of buildings [are here].

see these great buildings? One stone may not be
left upon [another] stone, which may not be torn-down.

of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and
John and Andrew asked him privately, <sup>13:4</sup> Tell us,

up! It was <span style="font-weight: bold"> good for him, if that [man]
was not <span style="font-weight: bold">[ever] born.

{Mar 14:22-25 & Mat 26:26-29 & Luk 22:19-20, 1Co
11:23-26.}
<sup>14:22</sup> And [while] they are eating, Jesus took bread
[and] having given-thanks, he broke it and gave [it] to
them and said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Take<span style="font-weight: bold">°, eat°; this is my body. <sup>14:23</sup> And
having taken the cup [and] having given-thanks, he
gave [it] to them, and they all drank out-of it. <sup>14:24</sup> And
he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">This is my blood, the [blood] of the
new covenant*, which is poured out concerning
many. <sup>14:25</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> <span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I am saying to you°, I should
never drink anymore from the fruit*<span style="font-weight: bold"> of the vine,
until that day whenever I drink it new in the
kingdom of God.


{Mar 14:26, 14:32-42 & Mat 26:30, 26:36-46 & Luk 22:39-46 & Joh 18:1 Garden between Stream of Kidron and Mountain
of Olives, Late Thur. night.}
<sup>14:26</sup> And having sung a hymn, they went forth to
the Mountain of Olives.
<sup>14:27</sup> And Jesus says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">All [of] you° will be
offended at me in this night, because it has been
written, “I will be striking the shepherd and the
sheep will be scattered.’  <sup>14:28</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But after the
[time for ]me to be raised, I will be preceding you°
into Galilee.
<sup>14:29</sup> But Peter said to him, Even if all will be
offended, but not I.
<sup>14:30</sup> And Jesus says to him,<span style="font-weight: bold"> Assuredly I am
saying to you, that today, [even] in this night, before
the rooster [is] to crow twice, you will be denying
me three-times.
<sup>14:31</sup> But [Peter] spoke rather exceptionally, If it
should be essential [for] me to die together-with you,
I should never deny you! Now likewise*, they also all
were saying [it.]

<sup>14:32</sup> And they come to a parcel of ground of which
the name [is] Gethsemane, and he says to his disciples,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Sit<span style="font-weight: bold">° here until I should pray. <sup>14:33</sup> And he takes Peter
and James and John with himself, and he began to be
utterly amazed and disheartened. <sup>14:34</sup> And he says to
them, <span style="font-weight: bold">My soul is very sorrowful until death,
remain<span style="font-weight: bold">° here and watch°.
<sup>14:35</sup> And having gone a little [further], he fell upon
the earth and was praying in-order-that, if it is
possible, the hour might pass away from him. <sup>14:36</sup>
And he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Abba, Father, all things [are] possible
for you; carry this cup away from me, but not
what I will, but what you [will].
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>14:37</sup> And he comes and finds them sleeping, and
says to Peter, <span style="font-weight: bold">Simon, do you sleep? Were you not
strong-enough to watch one hour? <sup>14:38</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Watch°<span style="font-weight: bold"> and
pray°, in-order-that you° may not enter into
temptation. The spirit [is] indeed eager, but the
flesh [is] weak.
<sup>14:39</sup> And again he went away [and] prayed, [and] said
the same speech.
<sup>14:40</sup> And having returned, he found them sleeping
again, for* their eyes were heavy, and they did not
know what they should answer him.
<sup>14:41</sup> And [while] coming the third-time, he says to
them,<span style="font-weight: bold">  Furthermore, are <span style="font-weight: bold">you° sleeping and resting
yourselves? It is adequate. 
<span style="font-weight: bold">The hour came [already]. Behold, the Son of
Man is given [up] into the hands of sinners.  <sup>14:42</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Arise<span style="font-weight: bold">°, we should proceed. Behold, the one giving
me up has drawn near.

{Mar 14:43-52 & Mat 26:47-56 & Luk 22:47-53 & Joh
18:2-11 Gethsemane, Fri. a few hours before dawn.}
<sup>14:43</sup> And immediately, [as] he is still speaking,
Judas, being one of the twelve, comes* and with him,
a large crowd with swords and clubs from the high-priests, and the scribes and the elders. <sup>14:44</sup> Now the
one giving him up, had given them a predefined
gesture, saying, Whomever I kiss, it is he; take-hold°
of him and securely lead° [him] away. <sup>14:45</sup> And having
gone [to the place], he went immediately to him [and]
says to him, Rabbi, rabbi, and kissed him. <sup>14:46</sup> Now
they put hands upon him and took-hold of him.
<sup>14:47</sup> But a certain one of the ones standing beside
[him], pulled the sword, [he had,] and struck the
bondservant of the high-priest and took off his ear.
<sup>14:48</sup> And Jesus answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Did
you° come forth, as against a robber with swords
and clubs to take me? <sup>14:49</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">I was with you° daily
teaching in the temple and you° have not taken-hold of me, but [this is done] in-order-that the
Scriptures might be fulfilled.

<sup>14:50</sup> And they all left him [and] fled. <sup>14:51</sup> And one,
a certain young-man followed with him, having been
dressed in a linen cloth over [his] naked [body], and the
young-men take-hold of him; <sup>14:52</sup> but he left the linen
cloth and fled from them naked.


{Mar 14:53 & Mat 26:57 & Luk 22:54a & Joh 18:24 Palace
of Caiaphas, before dawn.}
<sup>14:53</sup> And they led Jesus away to the high-priest,
and all the high-priests and the elders and the scribes
are coming together-with him [there].

{Mar 14:54 & Mat 26:58 & Luk 22:54b-62 & Joh 18:15-18
Courtyard of High Priest’s residence, Fri. around dawn.}
<sup>14:54</sup> And Peter followed him from afar, until [he
was] inside, into the courtyard of the high-priest, and
he was sitting together with the attendants and
warming himself in the light [of the fire].


<sup>14:55</sup> Now the high-priests and the whole council
were seeking testimony against Jesus, *that* they
might slay him, and they were not finding [it]. <sup>14:56</sup> For*
many were falsely testifying against him, and [yet]
the[ir] testimonies were not equal. <sup>14:57</sup> And some,
having stood up, were falsely testifying against him,
saying, <sup>14:58</sup> We heard him say, I will be tearing-down
this temple, the [one] made* with hands, and I will be
building another through three days not made* with
hands. <sup>14:59</sup> And thus, neither was their testimony
equal.
<sup>14:60</sup> And the high-priest having stood up in [the]
midst [of them], asked Jesus, saying, Are you
answering nothing? What are these [witnesses]
testifying against you? <sup>14:61</sup> But he was silent and
answered nothing. Again the high-priest asked him
and says to him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the
Gracious* [One]?
<sup>14:62</sup> But Jesus said, <span style="font-weight: bold">I am, and you° will be seeing
the Son of Man sitting at the right [hand] of power
and coming with the clouds of heaven.
<sup>14:63</sup> But the high-priest, having ripped his tunics,
says, Why do we still have need of witnesses? <sup>14:64</sup>
You° [have ]heard the blasphemy. What does it appear
to you°? Now they all condemned him to be liable of
death. <sup>14:65</sup> And some began to spit on him and to
cover his face and to batter him, and to say to him,
Prophesy! And the attendants were casting him
[around] with slaps on the cheek.

{Mar 14:66-72 & Mat 26:69-75 & Luk 22:55-62 & Joh
18:25-27.}
<sup>14:66</sup> And Peter being below in the courtyard, one
of the maidservants of the high-priest comes. <sup>14:67</sup>
And having seen Peter warming himself, she looked
at him and says, You were also with Jesus, the
Nazarene.
<sup>14:68</sup> But he denied [it], saying, I do not know [him],
nor know what you are saying, and he went outside
into the forecourt, and the rooster crowed.
<sup>14:69</sup> And the maidservant saw him [and] began
again to say to the ones standing beside [her], This [one]
is from them. <sup>14:70</sup> But he again was denying it. And
after a little [while], the ones standing beside [them]
were again saying to Peter, You truly are from them.
For* you are a Galilean and your speech is similar.
<sup>14:71</sup> But he began to curse and swear, I do not
know this man [of] whom you° are speaking [of]. <sup>14:72</sup>
And the rooster crowed the second-time. And Peter
was reminded [of] the declaration which Jesus said to
him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Before the rooster [is] to crow twice, you will
be denying me three-times. And having put [his
thoughts] upon [it], he was weeping.

{Mar 15:1 & Mat 27:1-2 Luk 22:66-23:1 & Joh 18:28a
Jerusalem early Fri. morning.}
<sup>15:1</sup> And immediately in the morning, the high-priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole
[ruling] council, made* a council [together and] bound
Jesus [and] carried [him] away and gave [him] up to
Pilate.

{Mat 27:3-10 & Acts 1:18-19 Fri. morning and toward the
future.}


<sup>15:2</sup> And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the
Jews?
But he answered [and] said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">You speak
[correctly].
<sup>15:3</sup> And the high-priests were accusing him of
many things, <sup></sup> [but He answered nothing].
<sup>15:4</sup> But Pilate asked him again, saying, Do you
answer nothing? Behold how-many things they are
testifying against you. <sup>15:5</sup> But Jesus no more
answered anything; so-then [making] Pilate to marvel.



{Mar 15:6-19 & Mat 27:15-30 & Joh 18:39-19:16 Fri.,
April 7, 30AD.}
<sup>15:6</sup> Now he [normally] released to them one
prisoner every [Passover] feast, whomever they asked
for. <sup>15:7</sup> Now there was one called* Barabbas, having
been bound with the fellow rioters [of his], who in the
riot had practiced murder. <sup>15:8</sup> And the crowd having
cried [out], began to ask [him to do] like he was doing* 
habitually for them. <sup>15:9</sup> But Pilate answered them,
saying, Do you° wish [that ]I might release to you° the
King of the Jews? <sup>15:10</sup> For* he knew that the high-priests had given him up because of envy. <sup>15:11</sup> But the
high-priests shook up the crowd, in-order-that he
should rather release Barabbas to them. <sup>15:12</sup> And
Pilate again answered [and] said to them, Therefore
what do you° wish [that] I might do* [to the one] whom
you° call* [the] King of the Jews?
<sup>15:13</sup> But they cried out again, Crucify him!
<sup>15:14</sup> But Pilate said to them, For* what evil did he
do*?
But they cried out even-more, Crucify him. <sup>15:15</sup>
Now Pilate, willing to do* what [was] sufficient for the
crowd, released to them Barabbas and gave up Jesus,
having scourged [him], in-order-that he might be
crucified.
<sup>15:16</sup> Now the soldiers led him away, inside the
courtyard, which is the palace, and they call together
the whole cohort . <sup>15:17</sup> And they clothe
him with purple, and braided a thorny crown, [and]
they place it around his [head]; <sup>15:18</sup> and they began to
greet him, Hail, King of the Jews! <sup>15:19</sup> And they were
beating his head with a reed and were spitting on
him, and placing the knees [down], they were
worshiping him.

{Mar 15:20-23 & Mat 27:31-34 & Luk 23:26-33 & Joh
19:17 Road to the Cross, Fri. morning.}
<sup>15:20</sup> And when they [had ]mocked him, they
stripped the purple [off] him and clothed him with [his]
own garments. And they lead him out in-order-that
they should crucify him. <sup>15:21</sup> And they compel a
certain one passing by, Simon from Cyrene, coming
from the rural-area, the father of Alexander and
Rufus, to go [with them], in-order-that he might lift up
his cross. <sup>15:22</sup> And they bring him upon the place
[called] Golgotha, which is, [after] being translated, The
place of a skull. <sup>15:23</sup> And they were giving to him
wine to drink, having been medicated with myrrh,
but he did not take it.

{Mar 15:24-32 & Mat 27:35-44 & Luk 23:33-43 & Joh
19:18-27 9:00 until Noon, Fri.}
<sup>15:24</sup> And having crucified him, “they divide his
garments, casting a lot upon them,’ who [and] what
[each] might take.  <sup>15:25</sup> Now it was the third
hour  and they crucified him. <sup>15:26</sup> And
the inscription of his accusation was written upon [the
cross], The King of the Jews. <sup>15:27</sup> And they crucify
two robbers together-with him; one at his right and
one at his left. <sup>15:28</sup> And the Scripture was fulfilled,
the one saying “And he was counted with [the]
lawless.’  <sup>15:29</sup> “And the ones who are
traveling by were blaspheming him, wagging their
heads’ and saying, Aha! He who [will] tear-down the
temple and build [it] in three days; <sup>15:30</sup> “save yourself
and come-down from the cross.’ 
<sup>15:31</sup> Likewise, also, the high-priests with the
scribes [were] mocking [him] with one another, [and]
were saying, He saved others[, but] he is not able to
save himself. <sup>15:32</sup> Let the Christ, the King of Israel,
come-down now from the cross, in-order-that we
may see and may believe in him. And the ones who
have been crucified together-with him were
reproaching him.


<sup>15:33</sup> Now [after] it became the sixth hour, it became
darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour
.

{Mar 15:34-41 & Mat 27:46-56 & Luk 23:45-49 & Joh
19:28-30 around 3:00 to 5:00 PM.}
<sup>15:34</sup> And Jesus cried in the ninth hour  
with a loud voice, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">Eloi, Eloi, lama
sabachthani? which is, [after] being translated, “My
God, my God, why did you forsake me?’ 
<sup>15:35</sup> And some of the ones standing beside [him],
having heard it, were saying, Behold, he is
summoning Elijah. <sup>15:36</sup> But one having ran and filled
a sponge from [the] vinegar [vessel], placed it around a
reed and was delivering a drink [to] him, saying,
Allow° [it, that] we may see if Elijah comes to take
him down.
<sup>15:37</sup> But Jesus expired, having left [with] a loud
voice. <sup>15:38</sup> And the curtain of the temple was split-apart, into two [pieces], from the top to the bottom. <sup>15:39</sup>
Now the centurion* standing [there], opposite from
him, saw that he thus cried out and expired, said,
Truly this man was [the] Son of God. <sup>15:40</sup> Now there
were also women viewing from afar, among whom
were both Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother
of James the little  and of Joses and Salome;
<sup>15:41</sup> who also, when he was in Galilee, were
following him and were serving him, and many other
[women] who came-up together-with him to Jerusalem.

{Mar 15:42-47 & Mat 27:57-66 & Luk 23:50-56 & Joh
19:31-42 Before The Sabbath.}
<sup>15:42</sup> And now [when] it became evening, since it
was [the] Preparation, which is, the daytime before the
Sabbath, <sup>15:43</sup> Joseph, a prominent counselor, came,
[who was] from Arimathaea, who himself was also
waiting for the kingdom of God, and having dared,
he entered to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
<sup>15:44</sup> Now Pilate marveled if already, he has died. And
having called the centurion*, he asked him if he had
died [for] very-long. <sup>15:45</sup> And having known [this] from
the centurion*, he bestowed the body to Joseph as a
gift. <sup>15:46</sup> And having bought a linen cloth and having
taken him down, he coiled [him] in the linen cloth, and
placed him in a tomb which was hewed out-of a rock,
and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
<sup>15:47</sup> Now Mary the Magdalene and Mary the [mother]
of Joses were viewing where he is placed.

[Mark 16] <a id="Mk16"></a>

{Mar 16:1-8 & Mat 28:1-8 & Luk 24:1-8, 12 & Joh 20:1-10
Dawn and very early Sun.}
<sup>16:1</sup> And [after] the Sabbath [had] elapsed, Mary the
Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of James and
Salome bought spices, in-order-that [after] they went
[there], they might anoint him. <sup>16:2</sup> And exceedingly
[early] in the morning of the first [day] of the week, they
are coming upon the tomb [after] the sun rose. <sup>16:3</sup> And
they were saying to themselves, Who will be rolling
away the stone from the door of the tomb for us? <sup>16:4</sup>
And having looked up, they view that the stone has
been rolled away; for* it was extremely great. <sup>16:5</sup> And
having entered into the tomb, they saw a young-man
sitting at [the] right [side], having been dressed in a
white robe, and they were utterly amazed.
<sup>16:6</sup> Now he says to them, Do° not be utterly
amazed. You° are seeking Jesus, the Nazarene, the
one who has been crucified. He was raised. He is not
here. Behold, the place where they [had] placed him.
<sup>16:7</sup> But proceed° away; say° to his disciples and Peter,
He precedes you° into Galilee. You° will be seeing
him there, like he said to you°. <sup>16:8</sup> And they went
forth and fled from the tomb. Now trembling and
astonishment were holding them, and they said
nothing to anyone; for* they were afraid.


<sup>16:9</sup> Now having risen* in the morning on the first
[day] of the week, he appeared first to Mary the
Magdalene, from whom he had cast forth seven
demons. <sup>16:10</sup> That one traveling [on], she reported to
the ones who came* with him, [who were] mourning
and weeping. <sup>16:11</sup> And [after] they heard that he is alive
and was seen by her, they disbelieved.



{Mar 16:12-13 & Luk 24:13-35 & 1Co 15:5 Sun.
Afternoon.}
<sup>16:12</sup> Now after these things, he was manifested in
a different form to two out-of them [while] they are
walking, traveling into the rural-area. <sup>16:13</sup> And they
went away [and] reported [it] to the rest, [but] they did not
believe those [men].


<sup>16:14</sup> Later, [while] reclining [at a meal], he was
manifested to the eleven themselves and he
reproached their unbelief and hardness of heart,
because they did not believe the ones who saw him,
that he has been raised.

{{ Introduction to Luke 60-62 AD

The Good-news account by Luke was written from a
historian’s point of view to Theophilus, Gentiles, and people
everywhere. This doctor, a close friend of Paul, a Greek and
Gentile Christian and the only Gentile writer in the New
Testament was very specific when describing when and where
things took place. As such, Luke is the most detail-oriented of
the four Good-news accounts. Beginning with the miraculous
birth of John (a relative of Jesus) and Jesus’ own birth six
months later, Luke reveals the life of Jesus in a very orderly
manner. Luke demonstrates how the Holy Spirit promotes belief
in Jesus as the Son of God in an accurate account of the life of
Christ presenting Christ as the perfect human savior. Luke also
influences his readers through various elements of a narrative
text of Scripture that is written from Rome or possibly Caesarea.
A key verse in Luke is 19: 9, 10 and our Lord and Savior's
mission to save mankind. Luke stresses the Savior's relationship
with people. It is in this biography of Jesus that we see Jesus
foretelling the completion of the Old Testament in the lifetime
of the people to whom He spoke (Luke 20:21-22). Jesus’ final
instructions to His apostles, after His resurrection, were
“Repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in [My
]name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem’ (Luke 24:47,
shown in Acts 2:38). Luke also wrote Acts: The Book of
Conversions.}}

[<a id="TOC1_11"></a>Luke 1] <a id="Lk1"></a>


<sup>1:1</sup> Since many undertook the task to compile a
narrative concerning the matters which have been
fully assured among us, <sup>1:2</sup> just-as they gave [them] to
us, the ones who became eyewitnesses and attendants
of the word from [the] beginning, <sup>1:3</sup> it also seemed
[good] to me, having followed accurately in all things
from the start, to write to you afterwards, most-excellent Theophilus, <sup>1:4</sup> in-order-that you might fully
know the certainty concerning the words of which
you were instructed.


<sup>1:5</sup> It happened in the days of Herod, the king of
Judea, [there was] a certain priest, Zacharias by name,
from the class* of Abijah and his wife [was] from the
daughters of Aaron and her name [was] Elisabeth. <sup>1:6</sup>
Now they were both righteous [and] blameless in
God’s sight, conducting-themselves in all the
commandments and ordinances of the Lord. <sup>1:7</sup> And
there was no child to them, insomuch as Elisabeth
was barren, and they were both advanced in their
days.

<sup>1:8</sup> Now it happened, while* he was doing priestly
duties in front of God in the order of his class*, <sup>1:9</sup>
according-to the custom of the priest’s office, he was
allotted to burn-incense, [after] he entered into the
temple of the Lord. <sup>1:10</sup> And all the multitude of the
people were praying outside in the hour of incense.
<sup>1:11</sup> And a messenger of the Lord was seen by him,
standing at the right [side] of [the] altar of incense. <sup>1:12</sup>
And Zacharias, having seen  [him], was disturbed, and
fear fell upon him.
<sup>1:13</sup> But the messenger said to him, Do not fear,
Zacharias, because your supplication was heard and
your wife Elisabeth will be giving-birth to a son to
you and you will call his name John. <sup>1:14</sup> And there
will be joy and gladness to you, and many will be
rejoicing at his birth. <sup>1:15</sup> For* he will be great in the
Lord’s sight, and he should never drink wine and
liquor, and he will be filled more [with the] Holy Spirit
[even] from his mother’s womb. <sup>1:16</sup> And he will be
turning many of the sons of Israel over [to] the Lord
their God. <sup>1:17</sup> And he will be going beforehand, in his
sight, in [the] spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the
hearts of the fathers again to [their] children, and [to
turn] [the] disobedient in [the] prudence of [the] righteous;
to make-ready a people who have been prepared for
[the] Lord.
<sup>1:18</sup> And Zacharias said to the messenger,
According-to what will I know this? For* I am an
elderly-man and my wife has advanced in her days.
<sup>1:19</sup> And the messenger answered [and] said to him,
I am Gabriel, who stands in God’s sight, and I was
sent to speak to you and to proclaim to you good-news with these things. <sup>1:20</sup> And behold, you will be
silent and not able to speak, till the day [that] these
things should happen, because you did not believe
my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.
<sup>1:21</sup> And the people were expecting Zacharias and
they were marveling while* he was delaying in the
temple. <sup>1:22</sup> But [after] he went forth, he was not able to
speak to them, and they recognized that he had seen
a vision in the temple, and he was signaling to them
and was remaining mute. <sup>1:23</sup> And it happened, as the
days of his ministry* were fulfilled, he went away to
his house.

<sup>1:24</sup> Now after these days, Elisabeth his wife
conceived, and she was hiding herself [for] five
months, saying, <sup>1:25</sup> Thus the Lord has done* to me in
the days in which he looked upon [me], to take away
my reproach among men.


<sup>1:26</sup> Now in the sixth month Gabriel the messenger
was sent by God to a city of Galilee, to which [is the]
name Nazareth, <sup>1:27</sup> to a virgin who has been engaged
to a man to which [is the] name Joseph, from the house
of David, and Mary [is] the name of the virgin. <sup>1:28</sup> And
the messenger entered to her, said, Hail! She who has
been favored. The Lord [is] with you. You have been
blessed among women. <sup>1:29</sup> But having seen him, she
was [very] disturbed at his speech, and was reasoning
what sort of greeting this might be. <sup>1:30</sup> And the
messenger said to her, Do not fear, Mary; for* you
found favor with God. <sup>1:31</sup> And behold, you will
conceive in [your] womb and will be bearing a son and
will call his name Jesus. <sup>1:32</sup> This one will be great
and will be called the Son of the Highest and the
Lord God will be giving to him the throne of his
father David, <sup>1:33</sup> and he will be reigning over the
house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end of
his kingdom.
<sup>1:34</sup> But Mary said to the messenger, How will this
be, since I do not know a man [sexually]?
<sup>1:35</sup> And the messenger answered [and] said to her,
[The] Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of
the Highest will be overshadowing you; hence the
holy one being born [out-of you ]will also be called the
Son of God. <sup>1:36</sup> And behold, Elisabeth your relative,
she also has conceived a son in her elderliness, and
this is the sixth month with her, the one being called
barren, <sup>1:37</sup> because every declaration from God will
not be powerless.
<sup>1:38</sup> But Mary said, Behold, the bondservant of the
Lord; let it happen to me according-to your
declaration. And the messenger went away from her.

<sup>1:39</sup> Now having risen* up in these days, Mary
traveled with diligence into the hill-country, into a
city of Judah, <sup>1:40</sup> and entered into the house of
Zacharias and greeted Elisabeth. <sup>1:41</sup> And it happened,
as Elisabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby
jumped in her womb, and Elisabeth was filled with
the Holy Spirit; <sup>1:42</sup> and she shouted out with a loud
voice and said, You have been blessed among
women, and the fruit of your womb has been blessed.
<sup>1:43</sup> And from where [did] this [come] to me, in-order-that the mother of my Lord should come to me? <sup>1:44</sup>
For* behold, as the voice of your greeting came* into
my ears, the baby jumped in my womb in gladness.
<sup>1:45</sup> And she who believed [is] fortunate, because there
will be a completion of the things which have been
spoken to her from the Lord.
<sup>1:46</sup> And Mary said, My soul applauds the Lord, <sup>1:47</sup>
and my spirit was glad upon God my Savior. <sup>1:48</sup>
Because he looked upon the humbleness of his
bondservant; for* behold, from hereafter, all
generations will esteem me fortunate. <sup>1:49</sup> Because the
mighty one did*  magnificent things to me and his
name [is] holy, <sup>1:50</sup> and his mercy [is] toward generations
of generations to the ones who fear him. <sup>1:51</sup> He
made* [his] dominion [known] with* his arm. He
scattered [the] haughty in [the] perception of their heart.
<sup>1:52</sup> He took down sovereigns from [their] thrones and
[has] exalted [the] humble. <sup>1:53</sup> He filled [the] hungry [with]
good [things], and he sent out the rich empty. <sup>1:54</sup> He
helped Israel his young-servant, [in order] to
remember [his] mercy, <sup>1:55</sup> just-as he spoke to our
fathers, to Abraham and his seed forever.

<sup>1:56</sup> Now Mary remained together-with her
approximately three months and returned to her
house.

<sup>1:57</sup> Now Elisabeth’s time was fulfilled [for] her to
bear, and she gave-birth to a son. <sup>1:58</sup> And the
dwellers  around [her,] and her relatives, heard that the
Lord was magnifying his mercy with her, and they
were rejoicing together-with her. <sup>1:59</sup> And it happened
on the eighth day; they came to circumcise the child,
and they were [to be] calling it upon  the
name of his father, Zacharias. <sup>1:60</sup> And his mother
answered [and] said, Not [so], but he will be called
John.
<sup>1:61</sup> And they said to her, There is no one among
your relative[s] who is called by this name. <sup>1:62</sup> But they
were signaling to his father, what he would wish him
to be called. <sup>1:63</sup> And he asked for a writing-tablet [and]
wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all
marveled. <sup>1:64</sup> Now his mouth was instantly opened,
and his tongue [loosed,] and he was speaking, thanking
God. <sup>1:65</sup> And fear came* upon all the ones dwelling
around them and all these declarations were being
talked-about in the whole hill-country of Judea. <sup>1:66</sup>
And all who heard, placed [these] in their heart, saying,
What then will this child be? And the hand of the
Lord was with him.
<sup>1:67</sup> And his father Zacharias was filled with [the]
Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying, <sup>1:68</sup> The Lord, the
God of Israel [is] gracious*. Because he visited and
made* redemption for his people. <sup>1:69</sup> And lifted up a
horn of salvation for us in the house of his young-servant David, <sup>1:70</sup> (just-as he spoke through [the]
mouth of his holy prophets from the age [past]). <sup>1:71</sup> [We
have] salvation from our enemies and from the hand
of all who hate us, <sup>1:72</sup> to do* [his] mercy with our
fathers and to remember his holy covenant*. <sup>1:73</sup> [We
have] the oath which he had sworn to Abraham our
father to give to us, <sup>1:74</sup> having been fearlessly rescued
out-of the hand of our enemies, to give-divine service
to him <sup>1:75</sup> in holiness and righteousness all the days
of our life in his sight. <sup>1:76</sup> And you, child, will be
called the prophet of the Highest; for* “you will be
traveling before the face of the Lord to prepare his
ways.’  <sup>1:77</sup> [You are] to give knowledge of
salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their
sins, <sup>1:78</sup> through the heart* of mercy of our God, in
which the rising [of light] from on high visited us, <sup>1:79</sup>
to appear to the ones sitting in darkness and the
shadow of death; to steer our feet into the way of
peace.

<sup>1:80</sup> Now the child was growing and becoming-powerful in spirit and was in the wilderness until the
day of his [public] showing to Israel.

[Luke 2] <a id="Lk2"></a>


{Augustus, a title, both the Latin form and Greek word
“sebastos’ are in the Bible (G828, G4575), which are adjectives
that means “worthy of worship. It is like our Reverend, His
Majesty, Your Worship, etc.’ This “worthy of worship’ became
worse as more and more Emperors took the throne. Even Nero
is referred to as the “Man of Sin’ in 2Th 2:3, the number of a
man in Rev 13:18 (666). Caesar is our “Emperor.’ Adjectives in
Greek occur after the noun so by rights this is His Reverend
Emperor in Luk 2:1. In Acts 25:2, 5; 27:1 - Augustus here
means simply “the Emperor’ and translated as such.}
<sup>2:1</sup> Now it happened in those days, a decree went
forth from Caesar Augustus to register all the
inhabited-earth. <sup>2:2</sup> This census happened first,
Quirinius being governor of Syria. <sup>2:3</sup> And all were
traveling to register themselves, each one into [his]
own city. <sup>2:4</sup> Now Joseph also went-up from Galilee,
out-of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of
David, which is called Bethlehem, because he is out-of the house and family of David; <sup>2:5</sup> to register
himself together-with Mary, who has been engaged
to him [as his] wife, being swollen [with child] {i.e.
pregnant}. <sup>2:6</sup> Now it happened, while* they were there,
the days were fulfilled the ones[ for] her to bear; <sup>2:7</sup> and
she bore her firstborn son, and she swaddled and
reclined him in the manger, because there was no
place for them in the boarding-house.

<sup>2:8</sup> And shepherds were in the same region,
camping out and observing watches over their flock
[by] night. <sup>2:9</sup> And behold, a messenger of the Lord
stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone
around them, and they were afraid [with] a great fear.
<sup>2:10</sup> And the messenger said to them, Do° not be
afraid; for* behold, I proclaim to you° good-news [of]
great joy which will be to all the people, <sup>2:11</sup> because
there was born to you° today in the city of David, a
Savior, who is Christ the Lord. <sup>2:12</sup> And this [is] the
sign to you°: you° will be finding a swaddled baby,
laying in a manger. <sup>2:13</sup> And suddenly, a multitude of
[the] heavenly army praising God happened [to be]
together-with the messenger, and saying, <sup>2:14</sup> Glory to
God in the highest, and peace upon earth, in men,
delight. <sup>2:15</sup> And it happened, as the messengers went
away from them into heaven, and the men, the
shepherds, said to one another, We should go
through, insofar as Bethlehem, and let us see this
declaration [about events] which has happened, which
the Lord made known to us!
<sup>2:16</sup> And they came, having hurried, and found both
Mary and Joseph and the baby laying in the manger.
<sup>2:17</sup> Now having seen [this], they made [it] known
concerning the declaration which was spoken to them
concerning this child. <sup>2:18</sup> And all who heard [it]
marveled concerning the things which were spoken
to them by the shepherds. <sup>2:19</sup> But Mary was keeping
all these words to herself, pondering [them] in her
heart. <sup>2:20</sup> And the shepherds returned, glorifying and
praising God in all the things which they heard and
saw, just-as it was spoken to them.

<sup>2:21</sup> And when eight days were fulfilled to
circumcise him, and his name was called Jesus,
which was called by the messenger before he [was] to
be conceived in the womb.

<sup>2:22</sup> And when the days of their cleansing
according-to the Law of Moses were fulfilled, they
led him up to Jerusalem to present [him] to the Lord
 <sup>2:23</sup> (as it has been written in [the] Law of
the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb will be
called holy to the Lord’);  <sup>2:24</sup> and to give
“A couple of turtledoves or two young doves [as] a
sacrifice according-to what has been spoken in [the]
Law of the Lord. 
<sup>2:25</sup> And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, to
which [is the ]name Simeon, and this man was
righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of
Israel and [the] Holy Spirit was upon him. <sup>2:26</sup> And it
was being divinely-spoken to him by the Holy Spirit,
[that] he should not see death, before he should see the
Lord’s Christ. <sup>2:27</sup> And he came in the Spirit into the
temple, while* the parents were bringing* in the child
Jesus, [for] them to do* according-to what has been [the]
custom of the law concerning him. <sup>2:28</sup> And he
accepted him into his arms and gave-thanks [to] God
and said, <sup>2:29</sup> Now Master, you [may] dismiss your
bondservant according-to your word in peace, <sup>2:30</sup>
because my eyes [have] seen your salvation <sup>2:31</sup> which
you prepared in the face of all peoples. <sup>2:32</sup> [He is] a
light *for revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of
your people Israel.
<sup>2:33</sup> And Joseph and his mother were marveling at
the things which were spoken concerning him; <sup>2:34</sup>
and Simeon gave-thanks for them, and said to Mary
his mother, Behold, this [child] is reserved *for the fall
and the resurrection of many in Israel, and *for a sign
being spoken against. <sup>2:35</sup> Now, also a long-sword,
itself, will be going through your [own] soul; *that
reasonings would be revealed out-of many hearts.
<sup>2:36</sup> And there was a prophetess, Anna, the
daughter of Phanuel, out-of the tribe of Asher (this
one [was] advanced in many days, having lived with a
husband seven years from her virginity, <sup>2:37</sup> and this
one [had been] a widow approximately eighty four
years), who did not withdraw from the temple,
giving-divine service with fasts and supplications
night and day. <sup>2:38</sup> And having stood up in [that] same
hour, this one herself was fully-professing the Lord
and was speaking concerning him to all the ones
waiting for the redemption in Jerusalem.

<sup>2:39</sup> And as they [had] completed all things
according-to the Law of the Lord, they returned into
Galilee, to their [own] city Nazareth.


<sup>2:40</sup> Now the child was growing and becoming-powerful in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the
favor of God was upon him.

<sup>2:41</sup> And his parents were traveling every year to
Jerusalem to the feast of the Passover. <sup>2:42</sup> And when
he became twelve years [old], they themselves went-up
to Jerusalem, according-to the custom of the feast; <sup>2:43</sup>
and having completed the days, while* they were
returning, the boy Jesus remained back in Jerusalem,
and Joseph and his mother did not know [it]. <sup>2:44</sup> But
having supposed him to be in the caravan, they went
a day’s journey, and they were seeking him among
the[ir] relatives and among the[ir] acquaintances. <sup>2:45</sup>
And having not found him, they returned to
Jerusalem, seeking him.
<sup>2:46</sup> And it happened, after three days they found
him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers,
both hearing them and asking them [questions]. <sup>2:47</sup>
Now all the ones hearing him were astonished at his
intelligence and his answers. <sup>2:48</sup> And [after] they saw
him, they were astounded, and his mother said to
him, Child, why have you done* so to us? Behold,
your father and I were seeking you, sorrowing.
<sup>2:49</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why [is it] that you° were
seeking me? Did you° not know it is essential [for]
me to be in the things of my father? <sup>2:50</sup> And they
did not understand the declaration which he spoke to
them. <sup>2:51</sup> And he went-down with them, and came to
Nazareth, and he was being subject to them and his
mother was keeping all these words in her heart.

<sup>2:52</sup> And Jesus was progressing in wisdom and in
stature, and in favor with God and men.

[Luke 3] <a id="Lk3"></a>

{Mar 1:1-8 & Mat 3:1-12 & Luk 3:1-18. Judea near Jordan
River 25 or 26 AD.}
<sup>3:1</sup> Now in the fifteenth year of the government of
Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of
Judea, and Herod being Tetrarch of Galilee, and his
brother Philip, Tetrarch of [the] region [made up] of
Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias [being] Tetrarch
of Abilene, <sup>3:2</sup> in [the] high-priest[hood]  of Annas and
Caiaphas, [the] declaration of God came* to John the
son of Zacharias in the wilderness. <sup>3:3</sup> And he came
into all the region around the Jordan, preaching [the]
immersion* of repentance into [ the] forgiveness of
sins; <sup>3:4</sup> as it has been written in the book of the
words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, “The voice of
one crying in the wilderness, Prepare° the way of the
Lord. Make*&#176; his paths straight. <sup>3:5</sup> Every valley will
be filled and every mountain and hill will be
humbled, and the crooked into straight and the rough
ways into smooth. <sup>3:6</sup> And all flesh will be seeing the
salvation of God.’ 

<sup>3:7</sup> Therefore, he was saying to the crowds who
travel out to be immersed* by him, Offsprings of
vipers! Who warned you° to flee from the future
wrath? <sup>3:8</sup> Therefore produce° fruits worthy of
repentance and do° not begin to say among
yourselves, We have Abraham [as our] father; for* I
say to you°, that God is able to lift [up] children to
Abraham from these stones. <sup>3:9</sup> Now the ax is also
already reserved toward the root of the trees.
Therefore, every tree which is not producing good
fruit is cut off and cast into the fire.
<sup>3:10</sup> And the crowds asked him, saying, Therefore
what will we do*?
<sup>3:11</sup> And he answered [and] says to them, He who
has two tunics, let him give [one] to the one who does
not have, and he who has [various] foods, let him do*
likewise.
<sup>3:12</sup> But tax collectors also came to be immersed*,
and they said to him, Teacher, what will we do*?
<sup>3:13</sup> And he said to them, Appropriate° no more
than what has been appointed for you°.
<sup>3:14</sup> But [the] active soldiers were also asking him,
saying, And we, what will we do*?
And he said to them, Intimidate° no one, nor cheat°
[anyone], and be° content with your° rations.

<sup>3:15</sup> But the people [are] expecting, and all [are]
reasoning in their hearts concerning John, maybe, he
might be the Christ; <sup>3:16</sup> John answered, saying to
[them] all, I indeed immerse* you° in water, but the
mightier one [than] I, he  is coming, the strap of whose
shoes I am not sufficient to loose. He will immerse*
you° in [the] Holy Spirit, and in fire; <sup>3:17</sup> whose
winnowing fan [is] in his hand, and he will be
thoroughly cleansing his threshing floor, and will be
gathering the grain into his barn, but the chaff he will
burn up with unquenchable fire.

<sup>3:18</sup> Therefore indeed, he was proclaiming the
good-news [to] the people, encouraging [them] also with
many other things.

{Mar 1:14a & Mat 4:12 & Luk 3:19-20 & Joh 4:1-4 Judea
to Galilee.}
<sup>3:19</sup> But Herod the Tetrarch, being reproved by him
concerning Herodias his brother’s wife and
concerning all the evil things which Herod practiced,
<sup>3:20</sup> also added this to [them] all, and locked John in the
prison.

{Mar 1:9-11 & Mat 3:13-17 Luk 3:21-22 Jordan east of
Jericho, Spring 27 AD.}
<sup>3:21</sup> Now it happened, while* all the people were
immersed*; [after] Jesus was also immersed*, and
[while] praying, the heaven opened, <sup>3:22</sup> and the Holy
Spirit descended in bodily form, like a dove upon
him, and a voice came* from heaven, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">You
are my beloved Son. I am delighted in you.


<sup>3:23</sup> And Jesus himself was approximately thirty
years [old, when] beginning [to teach], (being, as it was
supposed, the son of Joseph). [Although] he was [a
descendant] from Heli, <sup>3:24</sup> from Matthat, from Levi,
from Melchi, from Jannai, from Joseph, <sup>3:25</sup> from
Mattathias, from Amos, from Nahum, from Esli,
from Naggai, <sup>3:26</sup> from Maath, from Mattathias, from
Semein, from Joseph, from Joda, <sup>3:27</sup> from Joanan,
from Rhesa, from Zerubbabel, from Shealtiel, from
Neri, <sup>3:28</sup> from Melchi, from Addi, from Cosam, from
Elmadam, from Er, <sup>3:29</sup> from Joses, from Eliezer,
from Jorim, from Matthat, from Levi, <sup>3:30</sup> from
Symeon, from Judas, from Joseph, from Jonam, from
Eliakim, <sup>3:31</sup> from Melea, from Menna, from
Mattatha, from Nathan, from David, <sup>3:32</sup> from Jesse,
from Obed, from Boaz, from Salmon, from Nahshon,
<sup>3:33</sup> from Amminadab, from Ram, from Hezron, from
Perez, from Judah, <sup>3:34</sup> from Jacob, from Isaac, from
Abraham, from Terah, from Nahor, <sup>3:35</sup> from Serug,
from Reu, from Peleg, from Eber, from Shelah, <sup>3:36</sup>
from Cainan, from Arphaxad, from Shem, from
Noah, from Lamech, <sup>3:37</sup> from Methuselah, from
Enoch, from Jared, from Mahalaleel, from Cainan,
<sup>3:38</sup> from Enos, from Seth, from Adam, [who was] from
God.

[Luke 4] <a id="Lk4"></a>


<sup>4:1</sup> Now full of [the] Holy Spirit, Jesus returned from
the Jordan, and was being led by [the] Spirit into the
wilderness, <sup>4:2</sup> being tempted by the devil [for] forty
days. And he ate nothing in those days, and later,
[after] they themselves were  completed, he hungered.
<sup>4:3</sup> And the devil said to him, If you are the Son of
God, speak to this stone in-order-that it may become
bread.
<sup>4:4</sup> And Jesus answered to him, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">It has been
written, “Man will not live upon bread only, but
upon every declaration from God.’ 
<sup>4:5</sup> And the devil, having led him up into a high
mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the
inhabited-earth in an instant of time. <sup>4:6</sup> And the devil
said to him, I will be giving all this authority, and the
glory of them, to you, because it has been given to
me, and I am giving [it] to whomever I wish. <sup>4:7</sup>
Therefore, if you worship [only] in my sight, all [this]
will be yours.
<sup>4:8</sup> And Jesus answered [and] said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Proceed
behind me, adversary! It has been written, “You
will be worshiping the Lord your God and you
will be giving-divine service to him only.’ {Deu
6:13}
<sup>4:9</sup> And he led him to Jerusalem, and stood him
upon the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, If
you are [the] Son of God, cast yourself downward from
here. <sup>4:10</sup> For* it has been written, “He will be
commanding his messengers concerning you, to
guard you,’ <sup>4:11</sup> and, “They will lift you up upon [their]
hands, lest you might hit your foot with a stone.’ {Psa
91:11-12}
<sup>4:12</sup> And Jesus answered [and] said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">It has
been spoken, “Do not test the Lord your God.’

<sup>4:13</sup> And [after] the devil [had] completed every
temptation, he withdrew from him till [another] time.


<sup>4:14</sup> And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit
into Galilee.


And fame went forth throughout the whole region
around [there] concerning him. <sup>4:15</sup> And he was
teaching in their synagogues, being glorified by all.


<sup>4:16</sup> And he came to Nazareth, where he was being
reared up, and according-to his custom, he entered
into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up
to read. <sup>4:17</sup> And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was
given to him. And having unrolled the scroll, he
found the place [where] it had been written, <sup>4:18</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">“[The]
Spirit of the Lord [is] upon me, because of which,
he anointed me to proclaim the good-news to the
poor. He has sent me to heal the crushed in heart,
to preach deliverance to the captives, and
recovery of sight to the blind, to send forth [the]
downtrodden to deliverance, <sup>4:19<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">to preach the
acceptable year of the Lord.’  <sup>4:20</sup> And
having furled the scroll, he gave back to the
attendant. He sat [down], and the eyes of all were
staring at him in the synagogue. <sup>4:21</sup> But he began to
say to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">This Scripture has been fulfilled
today in your° ears.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>4:22</sup> And all were testifying of him, and were
marveling at the words of favor which are traveling
from his mouth, and they were saying, Is this not
Joseph’s son?
<sup>4:23</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">You° will certainly say
this parable to me, Physician, heal yourself. We
heard how-much [had] happened in Capernaum,
do* [it] here also <span style="font-weight: bold">in your fatherland. <sup>4:24</sup> But he said,<span style="font-weight: bold">
<span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I am saying to you°, No prophet is
acceptable in his fatherland. <sup>4:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But in truth I say
to you°, Many widows were in Israel in the days of 
Elijah, when the heaven was locked [for] three
years and six months, as [such] a great famine over
all the land happened; <sup>4:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and Elijah was sent to
none of them, except to Zarephath from Sidon, to
a woman [who was] a widow. <sup>4:27</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And many lepers
were <span style="font-weight: bold">in Israel in [the time] of Elisha the prophet,
and none of them were cleansed, except Naaman
the Syrian.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>4:28</sup> And they were all filled with fury in the
synagogue, [while] hearing these things; <sup>4:29</sup> and having 
risen* up, they cast him forth outside the city, and led
him to the brow of the mountain upon which their
city had been built, *that* they might propel him off
the cliff. <sup>4:30</sup> But having gone through the middle of
them, he was traveling [away].


<sup>4:31</sup> And he came down to Capernaum, a city of
Galilee. And he was teaching them on the Sabbath;
<sup>4:32</sup> and they were being astounded at his teaching,
because his word was with* authority. <sup>4:33</sup> And a man
was in the synagogue, who has a spirit of an unclean
demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, <sup>4:34</sup> saying,
Ah! What [is this thing] to us and to you, Jesus [the]
Nazarene? Did you come to destroy us? I know you,
who you are, the Holy One of God.
<sup>4:35</sup> And Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">Hush and
come forth out-of him. And [after] the demon tossed
him into the middle [of them], he came away from him,
having not harmed him.
<sup>4:36</sup> And amazement came* upon all, and they were
speaking together with one another, saying, What [is]
this word, because he commands the unclean spirits
with* authority and power, and they come forth? <sup>4:37</sup>
And a rumor was traveling out concerning him, into
every place of the region around.


<sup>4:38</sup> Now he rose* up from the synagogue and
entered into the house of Simon. Now Simon’s
mother-in-law was being held with a great fever, and
they asked him concerning her. <sup>4:39</sup> And he stood
above her [and] rebuked the fever, and it left her, and
instantly, she rose* up [and] was serving them.

<sup>4:40</sup> Now [at the] setting of the sun, all, as many as
had [anyone] sick with various diseases led them to
him, and having laid [his] hands upon each one of
them, he healed them. <sup>4:41</sup> Now demons were also
coming forth from many, crying out and saying, You
are the Christ, the Son of God. And rebuking [them],
he was not permitting them to speak, because they
knew him to be the Christ.

{Mar 1:35-39 & Mat 4:23-25 & Luk 4:42-44 Preaching
through Galilee.}
<sup>4:42</sup> Now [after] it became day, he went forth and
traveled into a desolate place, and the crowds were
seeking him and came to him, and were holding-onto
him to not travel away from them. <sup>4:43</sup> But he said to
them, <span style="font-weight: bold">It is essential [for] me to also proclaim the
good-news of the kingdom of God to the other
<span style="font-weight: bold">cities, because I have been sent forth to this [end].
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>4:44</sup> And he was preaching in the synagogues of
Galilee.

[Luke 5] <a id="Lk5"></a>

{Mar 1:16-20 & Mat 4:18-22 & Luk 5:1-11 Sea of Galilee
near Capernaum.}
<sup>5:1</sup> Now it happened, while* the crowd was
jamming against him to hear the word of God, and
[while] he was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret;
<sup>5:2</sup> and he saw two ships standing [empty] beside the
lake, but the fishermen, having stepped away from
them, rinsed their nets. <sup>5:3</sup> Now he stepped onto one
of the ships, which was Simon’s, and asked him to
set-sail a few [feet] from the land. And having sat
[down], he was teaching the crowds out-of the ship. <sup>5:4</sup>
Now as he ceased speaking, he said to Simon, <span style="font-weight: bold">Set-sail into the deep and lower<span style="font-weight: bold">° your° nets *for a
catch.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>5:5</sup> And Simon answered [and] said to him, Master*,
we labored through the whole night and took
nothing, but at your declaration I will lower the net.
<sup>5:6</sup> And having done* this, they locked up together a
large multitude of fish, and their net was being
ripped; <sup>5:7</sup> and they signaled to the[ir] companions, the
ones who had come in the other ship to help them.
And they came and filled both the ships, so-then they
[are about] to be submerged. <sup>5:8</sup> But  having seen it,
Simon Peter fell [down] before Jesus’ knees, saying,
Go away from me, because I am a man, a sinner,
Lord. <sup>5:9</sup> For* amazement engulfed him and all the
ones together-with him, at the catch of the fish in
which they took; <sup>5:10</sup> and likewise also James and
John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with
Simon.
And Jesus said to Simon,<span style="font-weight: bold"> Do not fear; from
hereafter you will be catching live men. <sup>5:11</sup> And
having brought* the ships upon the land, [and] having
left [it] all, they followed him.


<sup>5:12</sup> And it happened, while* he was in one of the
cities, behold, a man full of leprosy. And [after] he saw
Jesus, he fell upon his face, [and] besought of him,
saying, Lord, if you should will [it], you are able to
cleanse me.
<sup>5:13</sup> And having stretched out his hand, he touched
him, [and] said, <span style="font-weight: bold">I am willing; be cleansed. And
immediately the leprosy went away from him. <sup>5:14</sup>
And he commanded him to speak to no one, [saying],
<span style="font-weight: bold">But [<span style="font-weight: bold">after]<span style="font-weight: bold"> you [have] gone away, show yourself to
the priest and offer [the gift] concerning your
cleansing, just-as Moses commanded, *for a
testimony to them. 
<sup>5:15</sup> But the word concerning him was going
through [the land even] more, and large crowds were
coming together to hear and to be healed by him from
their sicknesses. <sup>5:16</sup> But he was departing by himself
in the wilderness and [was] praying.


<sup>5:17</sup> And it happened on one of the[se] days, [that] he
was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law
were sitting, who had come out-of every village of
Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem, and the power of
[the] Lord was [there], *that* he might heal them.
<sup>5:18</sup> And behold, [some] men [are] carrying a man who
was paralyzed upon a cot, and they were seeking to
bring him in and to place him in his sight. <sup>5:19</sup> And
having not found from what [way, that] they might
bring him in because of the crowd, they went-up to
the housetop [and] dropped him down through the tiles
together-with the cot, into the middle, before Jesus.
<sup>5:20</sup> And having seen their faith, he said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Man,
your sins have been forgiven to you.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>5:21</sup> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to
reason, saying, Who is this one, who is speaking
blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins, except God
only?
<sup>5:22</sup> But Jesus, having fully known their reasonings,
answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">What are you°
reasoning in your° hearts? <sup>5:23</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">What is easier, to
say, Your sins have been forgiven to you; or to
say, Lift yourself up and walk? <sup>5:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But in-order-that you° may know that the Son of Man has
authority upon the earth to forgive sins, (he said to
the one who has been paralyzed), <span style="font-weight: bold">I say to you, Lift
yourself up! And [after] you [have] taken up your cot,
travel to your house! <sup>5:25</sup> And instantly he stood up
in their sight, [after] he lifted up [that] upon which he
was reclining, [and] went away to his house, glorifying
God.
<sup>5:26</sup> And astonishment took all and they were
glorifying God, and they were filled with fear,
saying, We [have] seen glorious things today.

{Mar 2:13-14 & Mat 9:9 & Luk 5:27-28 At or near
Capernaum.}
<sup>5:27</sup> And after these things, he went forth and saw
a tax collector, Levi by name, sitting at the tax-office
and said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Follow me. <sup>5:28</sup> And having left all,
he stood up [and] followed him.


<sup>5:29</sup> And Levi made* for himself a great banquet in
his house and there was a large crowd of tax
collectors and others who were reclining [at the meal]
with them. <sup>5:30</sup> And the Pharisees and their scribes
were murmuring to his disciples, saying, Why do
you° eat and drink with the tax collectors and
sinners?
<sup>5:31</sup> And Jesus answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">The
ones who are healthy have no need of a physician,
but the ones who have ill[ness]. <sup>5:32</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">I have not come
to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>5:33</sup> But they said to him, Why do the disciples of
John fast frequently and are making* supplications;
likewise also the [disciples] of the Pharisees, but yours
eat and drink?
<sup>5:34</sup> But he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">You°<span style="font-weight: bold"> are not able to
make*<span style="font-weight: bold"> <span style="font-weight: bold">the sons of the bridal-party  {companions or
guests}<span style="font-weight: bold"> [them] to fast, in which [time] the bridegroom
is with them, are they? <sup>5:35</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But the days also will
come whenever the bridegroom is taken away
from them, then they will be fasting in those days.
<sup>5:36</sup> But he also spoke a parable to them: <span style="font-weight: bold">No one
puts a patch from a new garment upon an old
garment; otherwise, the new [and old will] split-apart and also the [patch] from the new [will] not
agree together-with the old. <sup>5:37</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And no one puts
new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the new
wine will burst the [old] wineskins, and it will be
poured out and the wineskins will be destroyed.
<sup>5:38</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But new wine [is] put into new wineskins, and
both are protected together. <sup>5:39</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And no one
having drunk old [wine], immediately wishes [for]
new; for* he says, The old is smoother.

[Luke 6] <a id="Lk6"></a>

{Mar 2:23-28 & Mat 12:1-8 & Luk 6:1-5 Jerusalem to
Galilee.}
<sup>6:1</sup> Now it happened [for] him to travel through the
grain-fields on a second Sabbath [after the] first [feast
Sabbath], and his disciples were plucking the tops,
rubbing [them] in the[ir] hands and were eating [them]. <sup>6:2</sup>
But some of the Pharisees said to them, Why are you°
doing*  what is not legal to practice on the Sabbath?
<sup>6:3</sup> And Jesus answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Did you°
not read even this, what David did*, when he
hungered, himself and the ones being with him? <sup>6:4</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">How he entered into the house of God and took
and ate the showbread, and also gave [it] to the
ones [being] with him; which it is not legal [for them]
to eat, except [for] the priests only?  <sup>6:5</sup>
And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">The Son of Man is lord of the
Sabbath.


<sup>6:6</sup> Now he happened also on a different Sabbath
[for] him to enter into the synagogue and to teach, and
a man was there, and his right hand was dried up. <sup>6:7</sup>
Now the scribes and the Pharisees were observing
[him], if he will heal [him] on the Sabbath; in-order-that
they might find an accusation [against] him. <sup>6:8</sup> But he
knew their reasonings, and he said to the man having
a dried up hand, <span style="font-weight: bold">Lift yourself up and stand, [you] in
the middle! Now he rose* up, [and] stood [there]. <sup>6:9</sup>
Therefore Jesus said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">I will ask you°
something, Is it legal on the Sabbath to do good or
to do*<span style="font-weight: bold"> evil? To save a life or to kill it? <sup>6:10</sup> And
having looked around [at] them all, he said to him,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Stretch out your hand. Now he did*, and his hand
was restored healthy like the other. <sup>6:11</sup> But they
themselves were filled with madness, and were
talking-about [this] to one another [as to] what they
should do* to Jesus.


<sup>6:12</sup> Now it happened in these days, [that] he went
forth into the mountain to pray, and he was persisting
through the night in prayer to God. <sup>6:13</sup> And when it
became day, [after] he summoned his disciples, and he
chose from them twelve, whom he also named
apostles: <sup>6:14</sup> Simon, whom he also named Peter, and
Andrew his brother, [and] James and John and Philip
and Bartholomew, <sup>6:15</sup> Matthew and Thomas, [and]
James the [son] of Alphaeus and Simon the one being
called [the] Zealot, <sup>6:16</sup> Judas [the son] {Or: brother of; See
Jude.} of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a
betrayer.


<sup>6:17</sup> And having gone-down with them, he stood
upon a place of [the] plain, and [with] a crowd of his
disciples and a large multitude of the people from all
Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea-coast of Tyre and
Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of
their diseases; <sup>6:18</sup> and the ones who are troubled by
unclean spirits were being healed. <sup>6:19</sup> And all the
crowd was seeking to touch him, because power was
coming forth from him and was healing [them] all.


<sup>6:20</sup> And he lifted up his eyes toward his disciples
[and] said: <span style="font-weight: bold">The poor [are] fortunate, because the
kingdom of God is yours°<span style="font-weight: bold">. <sup>6:21</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The hunger now [are]
fortunate, because you° will be fully-fed. The ones
weeping now [are] fortunate, because you° will be
laughing. <sup>6:22</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You° are fortunate, whenever men
hate you° and whenever they separate* you° [from
themselves,] and may reproach you° and may cast
forth your° name like evil, because of the Son of
Man. <sup>6:23</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Rejoice<span style="font-weight: bold">° in that day and jump° [for joy,]
for* behold your° reward [is] much in heaven; for*
their fathers were doing* according-to these [same]
things to the prophets.
<sup>6:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">However, woe to you°, the ones [who are] rich,
because you° are fully having your° consolation!
<sup>6:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Woe to you° who have been filled, because you°
will be hungry! Woe to you° who laugh now,
because you° will be mourning and will be
weeping! <sup>6:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Woe [to you° ]whenever men speak well
of you°, for* their fathers were doing* according-to
<span style="font-weight: bold">these [same] things to the false* prophets!

<sup>6:27</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But I am saying<span style="font-weight: bold"> to you° who hear, Love*&#176;
your° enemies, do<sup>*&#176;</sup> good to the ones who hate
you°, <sup>6:28</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">speak°<span style="font-weight: bold"> well of the ones cursing you°, pray°
on behalf of the ones railing at you°. <sup>6:29</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Hold near
to the one who beats you upon the [one] jaw, the
other also, and from the one who takes away your
garment, do not forbid [him] the tunic also. <sup>6:30</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Give
to everyone who asks you, and from the one who
takes away your things, do not ask for [them] back.

<sup>6:31</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And just-as you° wish that* men should do*<span style="font-weight: bold">
to you°, you° also, do<sup>*&#176;</sup> likewise to them. <sup>6:32</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And if
you° love* the ones loving* you°, what gratitude is
[this] for you°? For* even sinners love* the ones
loving* them. <sup>6:33</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And if you° do* good [to] the ones
who are doing*  good to you°, what gratitude is
[this] for you°? For* even sinners are doing*  the
same. <sup>6:34</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And if you° should lend [to those] from
whom you° are hoping to receive, what gratitude
is [this] for you°? For* even sinners are lending to
sinners, in-order-that they might receive equally.
<sup>6:35</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">However, love*&#176;<span style="font-weight: bold"> your° enemies and do<sup>*&#176;</sup> good
[things for them] and lend°, hoping for nothing
again. And your° reward will be much, and you°
will be sons of the Highest, because he is kind [even]
upon the unthankful and evil. <sup>6:36</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore,
become°<span style="font-weight: bold"> compassionate, just-as your° Father is
also compassionate.

<sup>6:37</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And do<span style="font-weight: bold">° not judge and you° should never be
judged; do° not sentence [others] and you° should
never be sentenced; release° and you° will be

will be giving good measure into your° bosom,
what has been packed-down and has been shaken
[together] and is poured over. For* with the same
measure you° measure, it will be measured to you°
again.

<sup>6:39</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now he spoke a parable to them: A blind
[person] is not able to guide the blind, is he? Will
they not both be falling into a ditch? <sup>6:40</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The
disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone
having been matured <span style="font-weight: bold">, will
be like his teacher. <sup>6:41</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But why are <span style="font-weight: bold">you looking at
the speck, the one in your brother’s eye, but do
not consider the beam the one in [your] own eye? <sup>6:42</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Or how are you able to say to your brother,
Brother, Allow [me, that] I may cast forth the speck
the one in your eye, [while]<span style="font-weight: bold"> you yourself do not see
the beam the one in your [own] eye? You hypocrite,
cast forth the beam first out-of your [own] eye, and
then you will see precisely to cast forth the speck
the one in your brother’s eye.


<sup>6:43</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* there is not a good tree producing
rotten fruit; nor [is there] a rotten tree producing
good fruit. <sup>6:44</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* each tree is known from [its]
own fruit. For* they do not collect figs from
thorns, nor do they pick a grape-cluster from a
bush. <sup>6:45</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The good man out-of the good treasure
of his heart brings forth what is good, and the evil
<span style="font-weight: bold">man out-of the evil treasure of his heart brings
forth what is evil; for* his mouth speaks out-of the
abundance of the heart.


<sup>6:46</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now why are you° calling me, Lord, Lord
and [yet] do not practice the things which I say? <sup>6:47</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Everyone who comes to me and hears my words,
and is practicing them, I will show you° to whom
he is similar. <sup>6:48</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">He is similar to a man building a
house, who dug and [then] deepened and placed [its]
foundation upon the rock, and[ after][<span style="font-weight: bold"> ]<span style="font-weight: bold">a deluge
happened, the river bursts against that house and
was not strong-enough to shake it; for* it had been
founded upon the rock. <sup>6:49</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  But he who heard and
did*  not, is similar to a man who built a house
upon the soil without a foundation; which the
river bursts against, and immediately it fell, and
the breakup of that house became great.

[Luke 7] <a id="Lk7"></a>


<sup>7:1</sup> Now since he [had] fulfilled all his declarations
in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
<sup>7:2</sup> Now a certain centurion’s bondservant, who was
precious to him, having an ill[ness], was about to die*.
<sup>7:3</sup> Now having heard [things] concerning Jesus, he sent
to him elders of the Jews; requesting of him, *that
[after] he has come [to him], he might cure his
bondservant. <sup>7:4</sup> Now [when] they came* to Jesus, they
were pleading with him diligently, saying, He is
worthy to whom you will be providing this; <sup>7:5</sup> for* he
loves* our nation and he built us the synagogue.
<sup>7:6</sup> Now Jesus was traveling together-with them.
Now already, [while ]he is not far distant from the
house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to
him, Lord, do not be bothered; for* I am not
sufficient that* you should enter under my roof. <sup>7:7</sup>
Hence, not even I myself deemed it worthy to come
to you, but say [it] with a word, and my young-servant
will be healed. <sup>7:8</sup> For* I am also a man appointed
under authority, having soldiers under myself, and I
say to this one, Travel and he travels, and to another,
Come and he comes, and to my bondservant, Do* this
and he does* it.
<sup>7:9</sup> Now having heard these things, Jesus marveled
at him and turned and said to the crowd following
him,<span style="font-weight: bold">  I say to you°, Not even in Israel, did I found
so-great a faith. <sup>7:10</sup> And the ones who were sent,
having returned to the house, found the sick
bondservant healthy.


<sup>7:11</sup> And it happened on the next [day], [that] he was
traveling to a city called Nain, and his considerable
[number of] disciples and a large crowd was traveling
together-with him. <sup>7:12</sup> Now as he drew near to the
gate of the city, behold also, [one who] has died, was
being entombed, the only begotten son of his mother
and she [was a] widow and a considerable crowd from
the city [was] together-with her. <sup>7:13</sup> And the Lord,
having seen her, had compassion upon her and said
to her,<span style="font-weight: bold"> Do not weep. <sup>7:14</sup> And he came near and
touched the funeral bier, and the ones bearing [it]
stopped. Now he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Young-man, I say to you,
Arise.
<sup>7:15</sup> And the [previously] dead one sat up and began
to speak. And he gave him to his mother. <sup>7:16</sup> Now
fear took all and they were glorifying God, saying, A
great prophet has been raised [up] among us, and that
God visited his people. <sup>7:17</sup> And this word went forth
concerning him in the whole [region] of Judea, and in
all the region around.


<sup>7:18</sup> And the disciples of John reported to him
concerning all these things. <sup>7:19</sup> And John, having
called to him a certain two of his disciples, sent [them]
to Jesus, saying, Are you the one [who is] coming or
are we expecting another?
<sup>7:20</sup> Now [after] the men came* to him, they said,
John the Immerser* sent us to you, saying, Are you
the one [who is] coming or are we expecting another?
<sup>7:21</sup> He healed many from [their] diseases and disorders
and evil spirits in the same hour, and he granted [to]
many [of the] blind to see.
<sup>7:22</sup> And Jesus answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">[After] 
traveling [back], report° to John the things which
you° saw and heard; that the blind recover [their]
sight, the lame are walking, the lepers are
cleansed, [the] mute hear, [the] dead are raised, [the]
poor [have] the good-news proclaimed [to them]. <sup>7:23</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">And whoever is not offended in me<span style="font-weight: bold"> is fortunate.

<sup>7:24</sup> Now [after] the messengers of John went away,
he began to say to the crowds concerning John,
<span style="font-weight: bold">What have you° gone forth into the wilderness to
see? A reed shaken by the wind? <sup>7:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But what
have you° gone forth to see? A man who has been
dressed-up in soft garments? Behold, the ones
[who are] in a glorious garment and being*<span style="font-weight: bold"> in
splendor, they are in [the] royal [courts]. <sup>7:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But what
have you° gone forth to see? A prophet? Yes, I say
to you°, And more-than a prophet. <sup>7:27</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">This is he
concerning whom it has been written, “Behold, I
send my messenger before your face, who will be
preparing your way before you.  <sup>7:28</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For*
I say to you°, Among those born of women there is
no prophet greater [than] John the Immerser*<span style="font-weight: bold">; but
he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater
[than] he. <sup>7:29</sup> And all the people and the tax collectors,
having heard [this], made  God righteous,
having been immersed* [in] the immersion* of John. <sup>7:30</sup>
But the Pharisees and the professors of the law
rejected the plan of God *for themselves, were not
immersed* by him. <sup>7:31</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> Therefore in what will be
similar [to] the men of this generation, and in what
are they similar? <sup>7:32</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">They are similar to children,
the ones sitting in the marketplace and [are]
shouting to one another and saying, We piped to
you° and you° did not dance; we mourned for you°
and you° did not weep. <sup>7:33</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* John the
Immerser* has come neither eating bread nor
drinking wine, and you° say, He has a demon. <sup>7:34</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Son of Man has come eating and drinking,
and you° say, Behold, a glutton and a drunkard,
a friend of tax collectors and sinners! <sup>7:35</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And
wisdom was made righteous from all her children.


<sup>7:36</sup> Now someone of the Pharisees asked him, in-order-that he might eat with him. And having entered
into the Pharisee’s house, he was reclining [at a meal.]
<sup>7:37</sup> And behold, a woman who was in the city, [who
was] a sinner, [after] she recognized that he is reclining
[at a meal] in the Pharisee’s house, she fetched an
alabaster flask of perfume, <sup>7:38</sup> and having stood
behind [him,] beside his feet, weeping, she began to
rain [on] his feet with [her] tears and was wiping [them]
with the hairs of her head and was kissing his feet,
and was anointing [them] with the perfume. <sup>7:39</sup> Now
the Pharisee, who invited him, saw it, [and] spoke in
himself, saying, This one, if he were a prophet,
would have known who and what sort of [person] the
woman is who is touching him, that she is a sinner.
<sup>7:40</sup> And Jesus answered [and] said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Simon,
I have something to say to you.
But he says, Teacher, say [it].
<sup>7:41</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Two debtors were <span style="font-weight: bold">to a lender: a certain one
was owing <span style="font-weight: bold">five hundred denarii and [the] other
fifty. <sup>7:42</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  But [after]<span style="font-weight: bold"> having nothing [for ]themselves
to repay [him with], he forgave* them both.
Therefore, tell [me] who of them will love* him
most?
<sup>7:43</sup> But Simon answered [and] said, I am taking [it
as], he to whom he forgave* the most.
But he said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">You judged correctly.
<sup>7:44</sup> And having turned to the woman, he said to
Simon, <span style="font-weight: bold">Do you see this woman? I entered into
your house, you gave me no water for my feet, but
she rained upon my feet with [her] tears and wiped
[them] with the hairs of her head. <sup>7:45</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You gave me
no kiss, but this [woman], from which [time] I
entered, she did not refrain-for a moment <span style="font-weight: bold">kissing
my feet. <sup>7:46</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You did not anoint my head with oil,
but this one, she anointed my feet with perfume.
<sup>7:47</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Because of which, I say to you, Her sins, the
many, have been forgiven, because she loved*
much, but to whom few is forgiven, [the same]
loves* few. <sup>7:48</sup> Now he said to her, <span style="font-weight: bold">Your sins have
been forgiven.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>7:49</sup> And the ones [who are] reclining [at the meal]
together-with [him] began to speak among themselves,
Who is this one, who forgives even sins?
<sup>7:50</sup> But he said to the woman, <span style="font-weight: bold">Your faith has
saved you. Travel in peace.

[Luke 8] <a id="Lk8"></a>


<sup>8:1</sup> And it happened in the [time] afterwards also,
[that] he was traveling through every city and village,
preaching and proclaiming the good-news of the
kingdom of God and the twelve [were] together-with
him, <sup>8:2</sup> and some women who were healed from [their]
evil spirits and sicknesses: Mary who is called
Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone
forth, <sup>8:3</sup> and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s
commissioner, and Susanna, and many others who
were serving them from the[ir] possessions with them.

<sup>8:4</sup> Now a large crowd [was] coming-together and he
spoke through a parable [to the ones who were]
traveling to him [from] every city. <sup>8:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The sower went
forth to sow his seed, and while*<span style="font-weight: bold"> he was sowing,
some which fell beside the road, and it was
trampled down and the birds of the heaven
devoured it. <sup>8:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And other [seed] fell upon the rock,
and [after]<span style="font-weight: bold"> it sprang up, it dried up, because it has
no  moisture. <sup>8:7</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And other [seed] fell in [the] midst of
the thorns, and the thorns sprang up together-with [it and ]choked it. <sup>8:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And other [seed] fell into
the good soil, and it sprang up [and] produced fruit
a hundred-times [over]. [While] saying these things, he
was shouting, <span style="font-weight: bold">He who has ears to hear, let him
hear.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>8:9</sup> But his disciples asked him, saying, What
might this parable be [about]?
<sup>8:10</sup> But he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">It has been given to you° to
know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but [it
is] in parables to the rest; in-order-that seeing,
they may not see; and hearing, they may not
understand. <span style="font-weight: bold"> <sup>8:11</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now the parable is this:
the seed is the word of God. <sup>8:12</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But the ones
beside the road are the ones who hear; thereafter,
the devil comes <span style="font-weight: bold">and takes away the word from
their heart, in-order-that they should not believe
and be saved. <sup>8:13</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But the ones upon the rock [are
the ones] who, whenever they hear, accept the
word with joy, and these have no root, who for a
[short] time believe, and withdraw<span style="font-weight: bold"> in time of
temptation. <sup>8:14</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But what fell into the thorns, these
are the ones who heard, and [while]<span style="font-weight: bold">[ they are
]traveling [on with life], they are choked by anxieties
and riches and sensual-delights of [this] life, and
they are not bringing [themselves] to maturity. <sup>8:15</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">But the [seed] in the good soil, these are they who
[have] heard the word<span style="font-weight: bold"> in a beautiful and good
heart, [and] hold-onto [it] and are bearing-fruit in
[their] endurance.

<sup>8:16</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now no one, having lit a lamp, hides it in a
vessel or places [it] underneath a bed, but places [it]
upon a lamp-stand, in-order-that the ones who
travel into [there] may see the light. <sup>8:17</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* not
[anything] is hidden, which will not become
apparent; nor [anything] hidden, which will not be
known and should come into apparent [view]. <sup>8:18</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> 
Therefore beware<span style="font-weight: bold">°, how you° hear; for* whoever
has, [more] will be given to him, and whoever does
not have, even what he seems to have will be taken
away from him.


<sup>8:19</sup> Now his mother and brethren came* to him,
and they were not able to get-close to him because of
the crowd. <sup>8:20</sup> And it was reported to him, saying,
Your mother and your brethren are standing outside,
wishing to see you.
<sup>8:21</sup> But he answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">My mother
and my brethren are these who hear the word of
God and [are] doing*  it.

{Mar 4:35-41 & Mat:8:18-27 & Luk 8:22-25 Sea of
Galilee.}
<sup>8:22</sup> And it happened on one of the days, [that] he
stepped onto a ship, himself and his disciples, and he
said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">We should go through toward the
[area] beyond-that of the lake. And they did set-sail.
<sup>8:23</sup> But [while] sailing, he slept and a gale of wind
descended onto the lake, and they were being filled
and were in peril.
<sup>8:24</sup> Now having gone [to him], they awakened him,
saying, Master*, Master*! We are perishing. But
having raised himself [up], he rebuked the wind and
the wave of the water, and they ceased, and it became
calm.
<sup>8:25</sup> Now he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Where is your° faith?
But they were afraid and marveled, saying to one
another, Who then is this, that he commands even the
winds and the water and they are obeying* him?


<sup>8:26</sup> And they sailed down to the region of the
Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee. <sup>8:27</sup> Now [after][ 
]he [ ]went forth upon the land, a certain man
out-of the city met him, who was held by demons,
and he had not clothed himself [with] a garment in
considerable times  and was not abiding
in [any] house, but [lived] in the tombs. <sup>8:28</sup> Now having
seen Jesus and having cried out, he fell [down] before
him, and said with a loud voice, What [is this thing]
with me and with you, Jesus, Son of the Highest
God? I beseech of you. Do not torment me. <sup>8:29</sup> For*
he commanded the unclean spirit to come forth from
the man. For* it had seized him many times, and he
was being bound in chains and shackles, [and ]being
guarded; and ripping the bonds, he was being driven
by the demon into the wilderness.
<sup>8:30</sup> Now Jesus asked him, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">What name is
in you?
Now he said, Legion. (Because many demons [had]
entered into him.) <sup>8:31</sup> And he was pleading with him
in-order-that he might not command them to go away
into the abyss. <sup>8:32</sup> Now a considerable herd of swine
was there, being fed at the mountain. And he was
pleading with him in-order-that he might permit<span style="font-weight: bold">*
them to enter into those [swine]. And he permitted*
them. <sup>8:33</sup> Now the demons having gone forth from
the man, entered into the swine, and the herd rushed
down the cliff into the lake and were choked [to
death]. <sup>8:34</sup> Now [after] the ones [who are] feeding [them]
saw what had happened, they fled and reported [it] in
the city and in the fields. <sup>8:35</sup> Now they went forth to
see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and
found the man, from whom the demons had gone
forth, sitting, having on garments and being sensible,
beside the feet of Jesus, and they were afraid. <sup>8:36</sup> But
the ones who saw it reported to them also, how he
who was demon-possessed was cured. <sup>8:37</sup> And all the
multitude of the region around the Gadarenes asked
him to go away from them, because they were being
held in great fear, and having stepped into the ship,
he returned. <sup>8:38</sup> Now the man from whom the demons
had gone forth, was beseeching to be together-with
him.
But Jesus dismissed him, saying, <sup>8:39</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Return to
your house, and describe how-much God did*  for
you. And he went away, preaching in the whole city
how-much Jesus did*  for him.

<sup>8:40</sup> Now it happened while* Jesus was returning,
the crowd accepted him; for* they were all expecting
him.

<sup>8:41</sup> And behold, a man to which [is the] name Jairus
came, and he possessed [the office of] ruler of the
synagogue, and having fallen beside Jesus’ feet, he
was pleading with him to enter into his house; <sup>8:42</sup>
because there was to him an only begotten daughter,
approximately twelve years [old], and this one was
dying. But while* he was proceeding away, the
crowds were choking him.

<sup>8:43</sup> And a woman, having a flowing of blood from
twelve years [old], who consumed the whole
livelihood [she had] with physicians, was not strong-enough to be healed by anyone. <sup>8:44</sup> She came near,
behind him [and ]touched the hem of his garment, and
instantly, the flowing of her blood stopped. <sup>8:45</sup> And
Jesus said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Who touched my [garment]?
But [while] all are denying [it], Peter and the ones
with him said, Master*, the crowds are crowding
together-with  you, and are pressing against [you] and
you say, Who touched my [garment]?
<sup>8:46</sup> But Jesus said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Someone touched me; for* I
knew [that] power went forth from me.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>8:47</sup> Now [after] the woman saw that she did not
elude [him], she came trembling, and having fallen
before him, reported to him in the sight of all the
people, because of what cause she touched him and
how she was healed instantly.
<sup>8:48</sup> Now he said to her, <span style="font-weight: bold">Have courage daughter,
your faith has cured you; travel in peace.

<sup>8:49</sup> [While] he himself is still speaking, someone
from the ruler of the synagogue [comes], saying to him,
Your daughter has died; do not bother the Teacher.
<sup>8:50</sup> But Jesus having heard it, answered him,
saying,<span style="font-weight: bold"> Do not fear. Only believe and she will be
cured. <sup>8:51</sup> Now [after] he came into the house, he
allowed no one to enter [it], except Peter and John and
James, and the father and the mother of the child. <sup>8:52</sup>
Now all were weeping and grieving her. But he said,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Do<span style="font-weight: bold">° not weep; she has not died, but is sleeping. <sup>8:53</sup>
And they were laughing at him, knowing that she [had]
died. <sup>8:54</sup> But he himself, having cast everyone outside
and having taken-hold of her hand, shouted, saying,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Child, arise. <sup>8:55</sup> And her spirit returned, and she
rose* up instantly, and he commanded[ something ]to
be given to her to eat. <sup>8:56</sup> And her parents were
astonished, but he commanded them to speak what
has happened to no one.

[Luke 9] <a id="Lk9"></a>

{Mar 6:6b-13 & Mat 9:35-10:42 & Luk 9:1-6 Third circuit
of Galilee.}
<sup>9:1</sup> Now having called the twelve together, he gave
them power and authority over all demons and to
heal diseases. <sup>9:2</sup> And he sent them forth to preach the
kingdom of God and to heal the ones who are sick. <sup>9:3</sup>
And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Take<span style="font-weight: bold">° nothing *for the
journey, neither staffs, nor knapsack, nor bread,
nor silver; nor to have two tunics apiece. <sup>9:4</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And
into whatever house you° enter, remain<span style="font-weight: bold">° there and
[then] go° forth from there. <sup>9:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And as many as
would not accept you°, [while]<span style="font-weight: bold"> you° go forth from
that city, shake-off° even the dust from your° feet
*for a testimony against them. <sup>9:6</sup> Now going forth,
they were going through every [one of] the villages,
proclaiming the good-news and healing everywhere.


<sup>9:7</sup> Now Herod the Tetrarch heard of all the things
happening by him, and was perplexed, because it is
said by some, that John has been raised from the
dead; <sup>9:8</sup> and by some, that Elijah had appeared, and
[by] others, that a prophet, one of the ancient [prophets]
[was] raised*. <sup>9:9</sup> And Herod said, I beheaded John, but
who is this one, concerning whom I am hearing such
things? Now he was seeking to see him.

{Mar 6:30-32 & Mat 14:13 & Luk 9:10 & Joh 6:1 East
shore of Galilee.}
<sup>9:10</sup> And having returned, the apostles described to
him how-much they [had ]done*. And having taken
them, he departed privately into a desolate place of a
city called Bethsaida.


<sup>9:11</sup> But the crowds, having known it, followed
him. And having accepted them, he was speaking to
them concerning the kingdom of God, and he was
healing the ones having the need of healing. <sup>9:12</sup> Now
the day began to be far-spent, and the twelve came
near [and] said to him, Dismiss the crowd, in-order-that [after] they [have] gone away into the surrounding
villages and the  rural-areas, and may board and may
find nutrition, because we are here in a desolate
place.
<sup>9:13</sup> But he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">You°, give° them
[something] to eat.
But they said, There are not to us more than five
loaves and two fish; unless [after] traveling [back], we
should buy foods *for all this [crowd of] people. <sup>9:14</sup>
For* they were approximately five thousand men.
Now he said to his disciples, <span style="font-weight: bold">Have° them recline
in parties, [approximately] fifty apiece. <sup>9:15</sup> And they
did*  so and they all reclined. <sup>9:16</sup> Now he took the
five loaves and the two fish, and looked up to
heaven, he gave-thanks and broke them. And he was
giving [them] to the disciples to place beside the
crowd. <sup>9:17</sup> And they ate and all were fully-fed, and
twelve baskets of broken pieces were lifted up, what
was leftover by them.

{Mar 8:27-30 & Mat 16:13-20 & Luk 9:18-21 Caesarea
Philippi.}
<sup>9:18</sup> And it happened, while* he was praying alone,
the disciples were together-with him and he asked
them, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">Who do the crowds say me to be {i.e.
that I am}<span style="font-weight: bold">?
<sup>9:19</sup> But they answered [and] said, John the
Immerser*, but others [say], Elijah, and others, that a
prophet, someone of the ancient [prophets] rose* up.
<sup>9:20</sup> But he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">But who do you° say me
to be <span style="font-weight: bold">?
<span style="font-weight: bold">But Peter answered [and] said, The Christ of God.
{Mar 8:31-9:1 & Mat 16:21-28 & Luk 9:22-27 Caesarea
Philippi.}
<sup>9:21</sup> But he rebuked and commanded them to speak
to no one [about] this thing, <sup>9:22</sup> [and] said, <span style="font-weight: bold">It is essential
[for] the Son of Man to suffer many things, and to
be rejected* away from the elders and high-priests
and scribes, and to be killed and to rise*<span style="font-weight: bold"> in the
third day.

<sup>9:23</sup> Now he said to all, <span style="font-weight: bold">If anyone wishes to come
after me, let him deny himself, and lift up his
cross and follow me. <sup>9:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* whoever wishes to
save his life will be losing [it], but whoever should
lose his life because of me, this one will be saving
it. <sup>9:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* what is a man profited, having gained
the whole world, but he himself was lost or was
forfeited? <sup>9:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* whoever is ashamed of me, and
of my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of
this one whenever he comes in his glory, and [the
glory] of the Father and of the holy messengers. <sup>9:27</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">But I tell you° truly, There are some of the ones
standing here, who should never taste of death,
until they should see the kingdom of God.

{Mar 9:2-13 & Mat 17:1-13 & Luk 9:28-36 Caesarea
Philippi.}
<sup>9:28</sup> Now it happened approximately eight days
after these words, [that] he took with [him] Peter and
John and James, and went-up into the mountain to
pray. <sup>9:29</sup> And it happened, while* he was praying, the
form of his face [became] a different [form], and his
garment [became] white [and] dazzling. <sup>9:30</sup> And behold,
two men were speaking together-with him, who were
Moses and Elijah; <sup>9:31</sup> who was seen in glory, [and]
were speaking of his exodus which he was about to
fulfill in Jerusalem. <sup>9:32</sup> Now Peter and the ones
together-with him were heavy with sleep; but [then]
having awaken thoroughly, they saw his glory and
the two men standing with him.
<sup>9:33</sup> And it happened, while* they were separating
from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master*, it is good [for]
us to be here, and we should make* three tabernacles:
one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah;
(not knowing [exactly] what he is saying).
<sup>9:34</sup> Now [while] he is saying these things, a cloud
became [apparent] and overshadowed them, and they
feared while* those [men] were entering into the cloud.
<sup>9:35</sup> And a voice came* out-of the cloud, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">This
is my beloved Son; hear<span style="font-weight: bold">° him. <sup>9:36</sup> And while* the
voice was happening, Jesus was found alone. And
they were silent and reported to no one in those days,
anything of the things which they have seen.

{Mar 9:14-29 & Mat 17:14-21 & Luk 9:37-43 Region of
Caesarea Philippi.}
<sup>9:37</sup> Now it happened, on the next day, [they]
themselves went down from the mountain, a large
crowd met him. <sup>9:38</sup> And behold, a man from the
crowd cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech of you to
look upon my son, because he is my only begotten
[son]. <sup>9:39</sup> And behold, a spirit takes him and he
suddenly cries out, and it convulses him with
foaming [from the mouth], and it departs from him
with difficulty, bruising him. <sup>9:40</sup> And I had besought
of your disciples in-order-that they might cast it
forth, and they were not able.
<sup>9:41</sup> And, Jesus answered [and] said, <span style="font-weight: bold">O unbelieving
and perverse generation, until when will I be with
you° and tolerate you°? Lead<span style="font-weight: bold"> your son here. <sup>9:42</sup> But
[while] coming near, still the demon ripped at him and
convulsed [him]. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit,
and healed the boy and gave him [back] to his father.
{Mar 9:30-32 & Mat 17:22-23 & Luk 9:43-45 Return to
Galilee.}
<sup>9:43</sup> Now they were all being astounded at the
majesty of God.
But [while all were] marveling upon all the things
which Jesus did*, he said to his disciples, <sup>9:44</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You°<span style="font-weight: bold">,
place<span style="font-weight: bold">° these words into your° ears; for* the Son of
Man is about to be given up into the hands of
men. <sup>9:45</sup> But they were not considering this
declaration, and it was hiding from them, in-order-that they might not sense it, and they were afraid to
ask him concerning this declaration.


<sup>9:46</sup> Now a reasoning entered [in] among them,
which of them would be the greater. <sup>9:47</sup> But [after]
Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he grabbed a
[young] child and stood him beside himself, <sup>9:48</sup> and
said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Whoever accepts this [young] child in
my name accepts me, and whoever accepts me,
accepts the one who sent me; for* he who is* least
among you° all, this one will be great.

<sup>9:49</sup> But John answered [and] said, Master*, we saw
someone casting forth demons in your name, and we
forbade him, because he is not following after us. <sup>9:50</sup>
And Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Do<span style="font-weight: bold">° not forbid [him]; for* he
who is not against us, is [fighting] on our behalf.


<sup>9:51</sup> Now it happened, while* the days were [being
]fulfilled of his taking up, and he established his face
to travel to Jerusalem, <sup>9:52</sup> and sent messengers before
his face, and traveling [away], they entered into a
village of the Samaritans, so-as to prepare for him.
<sup>9:53</sup> And they did not accept him, because his face was
[established to be] traveling to Jerusalem.
<sup>9:54</sup> Now [after] his disciples James and John saw
[this], they said, Lord, do you will [that] we should tell
[the] fire to descend from heaven and consume them as
Elijah also did* ?
<sup>9:55</sup> But he turned and rebuked them, and said,
<span style="font-weight: bold">You° do not know of what spirit you° are. <sup>9:56<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">For*
the Son of man came, not to destroy the lives of
men, but to save [them].


And they traveled to a different village. <sup>9:57</sup> Now
it happened [while they] themselves are traveling on
the road, a certain one said to him, I will be following
you wherever you go, Lord.
<sup>9:58</sup> And Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">The foxes have
burrows and the birds of the heaven [have] nests,
but the Son of Man has nowhere [that] he may bow
his head.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>9:59</sup> But he said to a different [one], <span style="font-weight: bold">Follow me.
But he said, Lord, permit* me first to bury my
father [after] I [have] gone [there]<span style="font-weight: bold">.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>9:60</sup> But Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Leave the dead to bury
their [own] dead, but <span style="font-weight: bold">you [while] you [have] gone
away, thoroughly proclaim the kingdom of God.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>9:61</sup> But a different [one] also said, I will be
following you, Lord, but permit<span style="font-weight: bold">* me first to bid
farewell to the ones [who are] in my house.
<sup>9:62</sup> But Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">No one, having put his
hand upon the plow and looking behind, is fit *for
the kingdom of God.

[Luke 10] <a id="Lk10"></a>


<sup>10:1</sup> Now after these things, the Lord also delegated
seventy others, and sent them two apiece {i.e. two by
two} into every city and place before his face, where
he himself was about to go. <sup>10:2</sup> Therefore he said to
them, <span style="font-weight: bold">The harvest [is] indeed large, but the workers
[are] few, therefore beseech<span style="font-weight: bold">° the Lord of the
harvest, *that he should put forth workers into his
harvest. <sup>10:3</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Proceed<span style="font-weight: bold">° away, behold, I am sending
you° forth like lambs in the midst of wolves. <sup>10:4</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Bear<span style="font-weight: bold">° no money-bag, no knapsack, nor shoes, and
greet no one down the road. <sup>10:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now into
whatever house you° enter, say<span style="font-weight: bold">° first, Peace [is] to
this house. <sup>10:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And if a son of peace is there, your°
peace will rest upon it, otherwise it will revisit
you°. <sup>10:7</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now abide<span style="font-weight: bold">° in [that] same house, eating and
drinking from their things; for* the worker is
worthy of his wages. Do° not go-away from house
to house.
<sup>10:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And into whatever city you° may enter, and
[if] they accept you°, eat<span style="font-weight: bold">° what is placed beside you°;
<sup>10:9</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and heal<span style="font-weight: bold">° the sick [who are ]in it and say° to
them, The kingdom of God has drawn near to
you°. <sup>10:10</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But into whatever city you° enter, and [if]
they do not accept you°, <span style="font-weight: bold">[after] you° [have] gone forth
into its streets, say°, <sup>10:11</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Even the dust from your°
city, what was glued to us, we wipe [off] to you°.
However, know<span style="font-weight: bold">° this, that the kingdom of God has
drawn near, [even] upon you°. <sup>10:12</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">I say to you°, It
will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than
for that city.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>10:13</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! Because if the miracles which
happened in Tyre and Sidon, the ones having
happened in you°, they would have repented long-ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. <sup>10:14</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">However it
will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the
judgment, than for you°. <sup>10:15</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And you,
Capernaum, who was exalted to heaven. You will
be descending to Hades. <sup>10:16</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The one hearing you°,
hears me; and the one rejecting you°, rejects me;
and the one rejecting me, rejects the one who sent
me.

<sup>10:17</sup> Now the seventy returned with joy, saying,
Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your
name.
<sup>10:18</sup> But he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">I was viewing the
Adversary, having fallen like lightning from
heaven. <sup>10:19</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  Behold, I am giving you° authority to
trample serpents and scorpions, and over all the
power of the enemy, and nothing should ever hurt
you<span style="font-weight: bold">°. <sup>10:20</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">However, do<span style="font-weight: bold">° not rejoice in this, that the
spirits are subject to you°, but rejoice° that your°
names were written in the heavens.

<sup>10:21</sup> Jesus was glad in the spirit in that same hour,
and said, <span style="font-weight: bold">I profess you, Father, Lord of the heaven
and the earth, because you hid these things from
the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to
infants. Yes Father, because thus it became a
delight before you.
<sup>10:22</sup> And having turned to the disciples, he said,
<span style="font-weight: bold">All things were given to me by my Father, and no
one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and
who the Father is, except the Son and he to
whomever the Son wills to reveal [him].
<sup>10:23</sup> And having turned to the disciples, he said
privately, <span style="font-weight: bold">The eyes, the ones seeing what you° see,
[are] fortunate. <sup>10:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* I say to you°, that many
prophets and kings wished to see the things which
you° are seeing and did not see [them], and to hear
the things which you° are hearing and did not
hear [them].


<sup>10:25</sup> And behold, a certain professor of the law
stood up, testing him and saying, Teacher, [by] having
practiced what, will I be inheriting everlasting life?
<sup>10:26</sup> But he said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">What has been written in
the law? How do you read [it]?
<sup>10:27</sup> But he answered [and] said, “You will love* the
Lord your God from your whole heart and from your
whole soul and from your whole strength and from
your whole mind, and your neighbor like yourself.’

<sup>10:28</sup> But he said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">You answered correctly.
Do* this and you will live.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>10:29</sup> But he, wishing to make himself righteous,
said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
<sup>10:30</sup> But Jesus, having taken [it in], said, <span style="font-weight: bold">A certain
man was going-down from Jerusalem to Jericho,
and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him
and laid wounds [on him]. They went away, [and] left
[him,] being half dead. 
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>10:31</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But a certain priest was going-down on
that road according-to <span style="font-weight: bold"> coincidence, and
having seen him, he evaded [him]. <sup>10:32</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now likewise,
a Levite also happened [to be] in the place, [when] he
came and saw [him], he evaded [him too]. 
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>10:33</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But a certain traveling Samaritan came
before him, and having seen him, had compassion.
<sup>10:34</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And having gone [to him], he bound up his
[various] traumas, pouring upon [them] oil and wine.
And having mounted him upon [his] own animal,
he led him to an inn and cared for him. <sup>10:35</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And
upon the next-day, [after ]he went forth, having put
out two denarii, he gave [them] to the innkeeper
and said, Care for him, and anything whatever
you spend over [that], I will be repaying you, in the[
time for] me to come back [through] again. <sup>10:36</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, who of these three seems to you to have
become a neighbor to the one who fell among the
robbers?
<sup>10:37</sup> Now he said, He who practiced  [an act of]
mercy with him.
Therefore, Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Travel, and you,
do* likewise!


<sup>10:38</sup> But it happened while* they were also
traveling, he entered into a certain village, and a
certain woman, Martha by name, accepted him into
her house. <sup>10:39</sup> And she was a sister to her, [the] one
called Mary, who also sat beside the feet of Jesus and
was hearing his word. <sup>10:40</sup> But Martha was being
distracted concerning much service [to them], and
having stood up, she said, Lord, do you not care that
my sister left me to serve alone? Therefore speak to
her in-order-that she may jointly help me.
<sup>10:41</sup> But Jesus answered [and] said to her, <span style="font-weight: bold">Martha,
Martha, you are anxious and disturbed
concerning many things, <sup>10:42</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">but there is need of
one [thing], and Mary has chosen for herself the
good part, which will not be taken away from her.

[Luke 11] <a id="Lk11"></a>

{Luk 11:1-13:9; Probably Judea; no parallel. This is similar
teaching to different crowd.}


<sup>11:1</sup> And it happened [for] him to be in a certain
place praying, [that] as he ceased, a certain one of his
disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, just-as
John also taught his disciples.
{The example prayer. The Lord's prayer is for unity in John
17. Also see 11:3 note.}
<sup>11:2</sup> Now he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Whenever you° pray,
say<span style="font-weight: bold">°, Our Father, the [one] in the heavens, let your
name be made holy. Let your kingdom come. Let
your will happen as in heaven, also upon the
earth. <sup>11:3</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Give to us<span style="font-weight: bold"> our <sup></sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">needful every day
bread. <sup>11:4</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And forgive us our sins; for* we
ourselves also forgive everyone who is obligated to
us. And do not bring us into temptation, but
rescue us from the evil [one].
{Footnotes: Luk 11:3, no one knows for sure what the
original word means. It is only in the N.T. twice and no where
else.}

<sup>11:5</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Who out-of you° will
have a friend, and will be traveling to him [at]
midnight and might say to him, Friend, lend me
three loaves, <sup>11:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">since a friend came*<span style="font-weight: bold"> to me, a
friend from a journey, and I have nothing [as to]
what I will be placing beside him. <sup>11:7</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And he
having answered [from] inside, might say, Do not be
harassing me. The door has already been locked
and my children are in the bunk with me. I am
not able to give to you [bread, even if] I [had] stood
up. <sup>11:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">I say to you°, Even if he has not stood up
[yet], he will be giving to him because [it is so] to be
his friend, yet because of his irreverence, [when ]<span style="font-weight: bold">he
[has] raised himself up, he will be giving him as
many as he needs.

<sup>11:9</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And I say to you°, Ask<span style="font-weight: bold">° and it will be given
[to] you°; seek° and you° will be finding; knock° and
it will be opened to you°. <sup>11:10</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* everyone who
asks, receives; and he who is seeking, finds; and it
will be opened <span style="font-weight: bold">to the one who knocks<span style="font-weight: bold">. <sup>11:11</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now
which father of you°<span style="font-weight: bold"> will the son ask for a loaf; he
will not be giving him a stone, will he? Or even a
fish, he will not giving him a serpent instead of a
fish, will he? <sup>11:12</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Or if he also asks for an egg, he
will not be giving him a scorpion, will he? <sup>11:13</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore<span style="font-weight: bold"> if you°, being* evil, know [how] to give
good presents to your° children, how-much more
will [your° ]Father from heaven give [the] Holy Spirit
to the ones asking him?


<sup>11:14</sup> Now he was casting forth a demon and it was
mute. And it happened, [after] the demon went forth,
the mute [man] spoke, and the crowds marveled. <sup>11:15</sup>
But some out-of them said, He is casting forth
demons in Beelzebub the ruler of the demons. <sup>11:16</sup>
But others, testing [him], were seeking a sign out-of
heaven from him.
<sup>11:17</sup> But he, knowing their minds, said to them,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Every kingdom which was divided against itself is
made desolate, and a house [divided] against a
house falls. <sup>11:18</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But if the Adversary was also
divided against himself, how will his kingdom be
established? Because you° say  [that it is ]me [who is
able] to cast forth demons in Beelzebub. <sup>11:19</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But if
I cast forth demons in Beelzebub, by whom do
your° sons cast [them] forth? Because of this, they
themselves will be your° judges. <sup>11:20</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But if I cast
forth demons by the finger of God; consequently*<span style="font-weight: bold">,
the kingdom of God [has] arrived-unexpectedly
upon you°.
<sup>11:21</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Whenever the strong [man] has been fully
armed<span style="font-weight: bold"> guards his [own] courtyard, the possessions,
[he has,] are in peace. <sup>11:22</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But whenever the [one]
mightier [than] he came upon [him] and [then],
overcomes him, he takes away his full-armor
upon which he had confidence in, and distributes
his [various] hauls. <sup>11:23</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">He who is not with me is
against me, and he who is not gathering with me,
scatters.

<sup>11:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The unclean spirit, whenever it [has ]gone
forth from the man, it goes through waterless
places, seeking rest, and [is] not finding [any], it says,
I will return to my house from where I came
forth. <sup>11:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And having gone [back], it finds [that] it
has been swept and has been adorned. <sup>11:26<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Then it
travels and takes [with it] seven other spirits [more]
evil [than] itself. And [after] it came [back], it is
dwelling there and the last [state] of that man
becomes worse [than] the first.

<sup>11:27</sup> Now it happened, while* he was speaking
these things, a certain woman out-of the crowd lifted
up [her] voice and said to him, The womb which bore
you, and the breasts which you nursed, [are] fortunate.
<sup>11:28</sup> But he himself said, <span style="font-weight: bold">But-rather, the ones
hearing the word of God and observing it, [are]
fortunate.



<sup>11:29</sup> Now [after] the crowds accumulated, he began
to say, <span style="font-weight: bold">This generation is an evil [generation]. It is
seeking after a sign, and no sign will be given to it
except the sign of Jonah the prophet. <sup>11:30</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For*
just-as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so
the Son of Man will also <span style="font-weight: bold">be to this generation. <sup>11:31</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The queen of the south will be arisen up with the
men of this generation in the judgment<span style="font-weight: bold">, and will
be condemning them, because she came from the
limits of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
and behold, more-than Solomon [is] here. <sup>11:32</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The
men of Nineveh will rise*<span style="font-weight: bold"> up in the judgment with
this generation, and will be condemning it,
because they repented at the preaching of Jonah,
and behold, more-than Jonah [is] here.


<sup>11:33</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">No one, having lit a lamp, places it in a
cellar, nor under the peck-container, but upon the
lamp-stand, in-order-that the ones who travel in
may see the radiance [of it]. <sup>11:34</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The lamp of the
body is the eye; therefore, whenever your eye is
clear, your whole body is also radiant, but
whenever it is evil, your body is also dark.  <sup>11:35</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, note [that ]the light which is in you is not
darkness. <sup>11:36</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, if your whole body [is]
radiant, not having any part dark, it will be
entirely radiant, as  whenever the lamp
illuminates you with [its] glow.


<sup>11:37</sup> Now while* he was speaking, a certain
Pharisee asked him, *that he might have a meal with
him, and having entered, he leaned-back [at the table.]
<sup>11:38</sup> Now [after] the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that
he had not first immersed*  himself before
a meal. <sup>11:39</sup> But the Lord said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Now you°, the
Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the
platter, but the inside of you° is full from ravening
and wickedness. <sup>11:40</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Fools, he who made*<span style="font-weight: bold"> the
outside, did he not also make* the inside?  <sup>11:41</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">However, the things [which are] within you°, give<span style="font-weight: bold">°
[those as] charity, and behold, all things are clean
to you°.
<sup>11:42</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But woe to you° Pharisees! Because you°
tithe mint and rue and every herb, and are
transgressing judgment and the love* of God<span style="font-weight: bold">. It
was essential to practice these things and to not
leave those[ undone]. <sup>11:43</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Woe to you° Pharisees!
Because you° love* the foremost seat in the
synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.
<sup>11:44</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Woe to you° scribes, and Pharisees,
hypocrites! Because you° are like the indistinct
tombs, and the men [who are ]walking upon [them]
do not know [it].

<sup>11:45</sup> Now someone of the professors of the law,
answered [and] says to him, Teacher, you are also
insulting us saying these things.
<sup>11:46</sup> But he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Woe also to you° professors of
the law! Because you° are loading men [down with]
unbearable loads, and you° yourselves do not
stroke the loads with one of your° fingers {i.e. you
don’t lift a finger to help}<span style="font-weight: bold">. <sup>11:47</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Woe to you°! Because
you° build the tombs of the prophets and your°
fathers killed them. <sup>11:48</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Consequently*<span style="font-weight: bold">, you° are
testifying and consenting to the works of your°
fathers, because they indeed killed them, and you°
build their tombs. <sup>11:49</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Because of this, the wisdom
of God also said, I will be sending prophets and
apostles to them<span style="font-weight: bold">, and [some] out-of them they will
be killing and will be banishing; <sup>11:50</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> in-order-that
the blood of all the prophets, being shed from the
conception of the world, may be sought from this
generation; <sup>11:51</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">from the <span style="font-weight: bold">blood of Abel  <span style="font-weight: bold">to
the blood of Zechariah, who perished between <span style="font-weight: bold">the
altar and the House [of the Lord].  <span style="font-weight: bold">Yes, I
say to you°, It will be sought from this generation.
<sup>11:52</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Woe to you° professors of the law! Because
you° took away the key of knowledge. You° did not
enter [in] yourselves, and you° forbade the ones [who
were] entering.

<sup>11:53</sup> Now [while] saying these things to them, the
scribes and the Pharisees began terribly to hold
[everything  ]against [him], and to quiz him [for
unrehearsed answers] concerning many things; <sup>11:54</sup>
plotting against him, seeking to trap [him in]
something out-of his mouth, in-order-that they might
accuse him.

[Luke 12] <a id="Lk12"></a>


<sup>12:1</sup> At which [time], [after] ten-thousand from the
crowd were gathered together, so-as to trample down
one another, he began to say to his disciples first,
<span style="font-weight: bold">Take-heed<span style="font-weight: bold">° to yourselves, [stay] away from the
leaven of the Pharisees; it is hypocrisy.
<sup>12:2</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But there is nothing which has been covered
up, which will not be revealed; and secret, which
will not be known. <sup>12:3</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Because as many things as
you° said in the darkness will be heard in the
light, and what you° spoke in the ear in the
storerooms will be preached toward the
housetops.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>12:4</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But I am saying<span style="font-weight: bold"> to you° my friends, Do° not
[have] fear from the ones who kill the body and [yet]
do not have, after these things, anything more-than [that] to do*<span style="font-weight: bold"> [against you°]. <sup>12:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But I will be
showing to you° whom you° should fear. Fear<span style="font-weight: bold">° the
one, who after you have been killed, has authority
to cast [you°] into hell. Yes, I say to you°, Fear° this
one.
<sup>12:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Are not five sparrows sold [for] two copper-coins? And not one out-of them has been
forgotten in God’s sight. <sup>12:7</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But even the hairs of
your° head have all been numbered. Therefore do°<span style="font-weight: bold">
not fear. You° carry more-value-than many
sparrows.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>12:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now I say to you°, Everyone, whomever
confesses [to be] in me before men, the Son of Man
will also confess [to be] in him before the
messengers of God.  <sup>12:9</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But he who denied me in
the sight of men will be denied in the sight of the
messengers of God.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>12:10</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And everyone who will speak a
[blasphemous] word at the Son of Man, it will be
forgiven him, but to the one who blasphemed at
the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>12:11</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But whenever they may bring you° in front
of the synagogues and the rulers and the
authorities, do<span style="font-weight: bold">° not be anxious [concerning] how, or
what you° should [need to] make a defense, or what
you° should say, <sup>12:12</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">for* the Holy Spirit will teach
you° in [that ]same hour what it is essential [for you°]
to say.

<sup>12:13</sup> Now someone out-of the crowd said to him,
Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance
with me.
<sup>12:14</sup> But he said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Man, who designated me
a justice or a divider over you<span style="font-weight: bold">°?
<sup>12:15</sup> Now he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">See<span style="font-weight: bold">° and guard°
yourselves from greed, because not to anyone is
his life in the [greed] to abound from his
possessions.
<sup>12:16</sup> Now he spoke a parable to them, saying: <span style="font-weight: bold">The
farmland of a certain rich man was fertile; <sup>12:17</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">and he was reasoning in <span style="font-weight: bold">himself, saying, What
should I do*, because I have nowhere, [in which], I
will gather together my fruits? <sup>12:18</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And he said, I
will be doing*  this: I will be taking down my
barns and build greater [ones.] And I will be
gathering together there, all my fruits<span style="font-weight: bold">* [of labor]
and my good things. <sup>12:19</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And I will be saying to
my soul, Soul, you have many good things laying
[up] *for many years; rest yourself, eat, drink, [and]
be joyous.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>12:20</sup> But God said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Fool, they asked back
your soul from you in this night, and the things
which you prepared, to whom will it [all] be [going]?
<sup>12:21</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">So [is] the one storing up [treasure] for himself,
and [is] not [being] rich toward God.


<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>12:22</sup> Now he said to his disciples, <span style="font-weight: bold">Because of this,
I am saying to you°, Do<span style="font-weight: bold">° not be anxious for your°
life, what you° might eat; not even what you°
might clothe [your°] body with. <sup>12:23</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The life [you°
have] is more-than the nourishment, and the body
[is more-than] the clothing. <sup>12:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Consider<span style="font-weight: bold">° the
ravens, that they do not sow nor reap for which
there is no storeroom nor a barn, and God
nourishes them. How-much do you° rather carry
more-value-than the birds! <sup>12:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But who out-of
you°, [by] being anxious, is able to add one cubit
upon his stature?  <sup>12:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, if you° are not
able [to add ]a little thing, why are you° anxious
concerning the rest? <sup>12:27</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Consider<span style="font-weight: bold">° the lilies,
somehow they are growing. They are not laboring
nor are they spinning; but I say to you°, Even
Solomon in all his glory, was not dressed like one
of these. <sup>12:28</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But if God so dresses-up the grass in
the field, which today is [here] and the next-day is
cast into the oven; how-much more [will he clothe]
you°, [the] small faith [ones]? <sup>12:29</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And do°<span style="font-weight: bold"> not seek
what you° might eat or what you° might drink,
and do° not be in [anxious] suspense. <sup>12:30</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* the
nations of the world are seeking after all these
things, but your° Father knows that you° have
needs of these things. <sup>12:31</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">However, seek<span style="font-weight: bold">° the
kingdom of God and all these things will be added
to you°.

<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>12:32</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> Do not fear, little flock, because your°
Father was delighted to give you° the kingdom.
<sup>12:33</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Sell<span style="font-weight: bold">° your° possessions and give° [as] charity;
make*&#176; for yourselves money-bags which do not
become-obsolete, an unfailing treasure in the
heavens, where no thief draws near, nor moth
corrupts. <sup>12:34</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* where your° treasure is, your°
heart will be there also<span style="font-weight: bold">.

<sup>12:35</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Let°<span style="font-weight: bold"> your° loins be girded, and the lamps
burning; <sup>12:36</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and you° [are] similar to men waiting
for their lord, [as to] when he might vacate from the
marriage-<span style="font-weight: bold">festivities; in-order-that [after] he came
and  knocked, they may immediately open to him,.
<sup>12:37</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The fortunate<span style="font-weight: bold"> bondservants [are ]those whom
the lord will find watching, [after] he has come [to
them]. Assuredly I am saying to you°, that he will
gird himself, and will recline them [at the meal ]<span style="font-weight: bold">{i.e.
seat them}, and having passed beside [them], he will
be serving them. <sup>12:38</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And if he comes in the second
watch, and in the third, and should find [them] so,
those are fortunate bondservants[.]
[]<sup>12:39</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But know<span style="font-weight: bold">° this, that if the householder
knew in what hour the thief is coming, he would
have watched, and not [have] allowed his house [roof]
to be burrowed through. <sup>12:40</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You°<span style="font-weight: bold"> therefore, also
become° prepared, because in an hour that you°
do not think the Son of Man is coming, [he comes].

<sup>12:41</sup> Now Peter said to him, Lord, are you saying
this parable to us, or even to all?
<sup>12:42</sup> But the Lord said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Who then is the faithful
and prudent steward, whom the lord will be
designating over his bondservants, the one to give
[them ]the[ir] food-allowance in season? <sup>12:43</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">That
fortunate<span style="font-weight: bold"> bondservant, whom his lord will find so
doing*  [after] he has come. <sup>12:44</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Truly I say to you°,
that he will be designating him over all his
possessions. <sup>12:45</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But if that bondservant says in
his heart, my lord delays to come, and may begin
to beat the young-servants and the maidservants,
and to eat and drink, and to be drunken; <sup>12:46</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">the
lord of that bondservant will be coming in a day
in which he is not expecting, and in an hour in
which he does not know, and will be flogging him
and will be placing his part with the unbelieving.
<sup>12:47</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But that bondservant, who knew his lord’s
will and did not prepare, nor did* pertaining to
his will, will be whipped [with] many [lashes]; <sup>12:48</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">but
he who did not know and did*  [things] worthy of
lashes, will be whipped [with] few [lashes]. But to
everyone in which much was given, much will be
required from him, and to whom were consigned
much, they will be asking even-more [from] him.

<sup>12:49</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">I came to cast fire into the earth, and what
do I wish, if it was already lit? <sup>12:50</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But I have an
immersion*<span style="font-weight: bold"> to be immersed* [in], and how I am
very troubled until which [time] it should be
completed! <sup>12:51</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You° are thinking that I came* to
give peace in the earth? I tell you°, No, but [rather
]division. <sup>12:52</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* there will be from hereafter five
in one house having been divided, three against
two, and two against three. <sup>12:53</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Father will be
divided against son, and son against father;
mother against daughter, and daughter against
mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

<sup>12:54</sup> Now he also said to the crowds, <span style="font-weight: bold">Whenever
you° see the cloud rising from the west,
immediately you° say, A thunderstorm is coming,
and so it happens. <sup>12:55</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And whenever [the] south
[wind is] blowing, you° say, There will be a burning
heat, and it happens. <sup>12:56</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">You° hypocrites, you°
know [how] to test  <span style="font-weight: bold">the face of the earth
and the heaven, but how do you° not test {i.e.
decipher<span style="font-weight: bold">}<span style="font-weight: bold"> this time? <sup>12:57</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But why are you° not
judging the righteous thing[s], even from [among]
yourselves? <sup>12:58</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* as you are proceeding away
on the road with your opponent [to be] in front of
the ruler, give[ ]work  <span style="font-weight: bold">to have yourself
set-free from him; lest he might drag you down to
the judge and the judge might give you to the
constable and the constable might cast you into
prison. <sup>12:59</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">I say to you, you might never come
forth from there, until which [time] you should
repay even the last bronze-coin.

[Luke 13] <a id="Lk13"></a>

<sup>13:1</sup> Now some were here at the same time
reporting to him concerning the Galileans, whose
blood Pilate mixed with their sacrifices. <sup>13:2</sup> And
Jesus answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Do you° think that
these Galileans became sinners [more] than all the
[other] Galileans, because they have suffered such
things? <sup>13:3</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  I am saying to you°, No, but, if you° do
not repent, you° will all likewise* perish. <sup>13:4<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Or
those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam
fell and killed them, do you° think that these
became debtors [more] than all [other] men who are
dwelling in Jerusalem? <sup>13:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">I am saying to you°, No,
but, if you° do not repent, you° will all likewise
perish.

<sup>13:6</sup> Now he spoke this parable: <span style="font-weight: bold">A certain one had
a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came
seeking fruit in it and found nothing. <sup>13:7</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now he
said to the vine-dresser, Behold three years, I
come seeking fruit and find nothing in this fig
tree. Cut it off. Why does it also do-away-with the
[good] soil?
<sup>13:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But he answered [and] says to him, Lord,
Also leave it [for] this year, until which [time], I
should dig around it and put [in more ]manures; <sup>13:9</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">and if it indeed produces fruit, [good]; otherwise<span style="font-weight: bold">
you will be cutting it off in the future.

{Luk 13:10-17:10; Probably Peraea; no parallel. This is
similar teaching but a different crowd.}
<sup>13:10</sup> Now he was teaching in one of the
synagogues on the Sabbath. <sup>13:11</sup> And behold, there
was a woman having a spirit of sickness [for] eighteen
years, and she was [always] stooped over and was not
able to completely stand-erect. <sup>13:12</sup> Now having seen
her, Jesus summoned [her] and said to her, <span style="font-weight: bold">Woman,
you have been released from your sickness. <sup>13:13</sup>
And he laid [his] hands upon her and instantly she was
straightened and was glorifying God.
<sup>13:14</sup> Now the ruler of the synagogue, being
indignant because Jesus [had] healed on the Sabbath,
answered [and] said to the crowd, There are six days in
which it is essential [for men] to work; therefore  be°
healed, coming in these [days], and not on the day of
the Sabbath.
<sup>13:15</sup> Therefore the Lord answered him and said,<span style="font-weight: bold"> [O]
hypocrites, do not each of you° on the Sabbath
loose his bull or his donkey from the manger and
having led him away, deliver [to it] a drink? <sup>13:16</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Now this one, being a daughter of Abraham,
behold, whom the Adversary  bound [for] eighteen
years, is it not essential [for her] to be loosed from
this bond on the day of the Sabbath?
<sup>13:17</sup> And [while] saying these things, all the ones
who are laying in opposition to him were being
shamed, and all the crowd was rejoicing at all the
glorious things which happened by him.


<sup>13:18</sup> Now he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">The kingdom of God is similar
to what? And what will [I make] it similar to? <sup>13:19</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">It
is similar to a kernel of a mustard-seed, which a
man took [and] cast into his garden, and it grew
and became a great tree, and the birds of the
heaven nested in its branches.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>13:20</sup> Again he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">The kingdom of God will be
similar to what? <sup>13:21</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">It is similar to leaven, which
a woman took [and] hid in three three-gallon-containers of flour, until it was entirely leavened.

{Luk 13:22-35; Peraea; Luk 14:1-24 Probably Peraea; Luk
14:25-17:10; no parallels.}
<sup>13:22</sup> And he was traveling through, every [one of]
the cities and villages, teaching and making* [his]
pursuit toward Jerusalem. <sup>13:23</sup> Now someone said to
him, Lord, if few [of] the ones are saved, [what then]?
But he said to them, <sup>13:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Struggle°<span style="font-weight: bold"> to enter [in]
through the narrow gate, because I am saying to
you°, Many will be seeking to enter [in] and will not
be strong-enough. <sup>13:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">From which [time] the
householder would have arose and locked the
door and you°, [being] outside, may begin to stand
and to knock [on] the door, saying, Lord, Lord,
open to us.
<span style="font-weight: bold">And having <span style="font-weight: bold">answered, he will say to you°, I do
not know you° [or] where you° are from.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>13:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Then you° will begin to say, We ate and
drank in your sight and you taught in our streets.
<sup>13:27</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And he will say, I say to you°, I do not know
you° [or] where you° are from. Withdraw<span style="font-weight: bold">° from me,
all the workers of unrighteousness. <sup>13:28</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The
weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be there,
whenever you° <span style="font-weight: bold">see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob,
and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and
you°<span style="font-weight: bold"> being cast forth outside. <sup>13:29</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And they will be
coming from [the] east and west and north and
south, and will be reclined in the kingdom of God.
<sup>13:30</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And behold, there are last who will be first
and there are first who will be last.

<sup>13:31</sup> Some Pharisees came near in the same day,
saying to him, Come forth and travel from here,
because Herod wishes to kill you.
<sup>13:32</sup> And he said to them, [<span style="font-weight: bold">After]<span style="font-weight: bold"> traveling [back], 
say<span style="font-weight: bold">° to this fox, Behold, I cast forth demons and
perform healings today and the next-day and I am
completed in the third [day]. <sup>13:33</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">However it is
essential [to] me to travel [on] today and the next-day
and [in] the next [day], because it is not acceptable
[for] a prophet to perish outside [of] Jerusalem.


<sup>13:34</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Jerusalem, Jerusalem, she who kills the
prophets and stones the ones who have been sent
to her! How-often I willed to gather together your
children in the manner a bird [gathers together] her
[own ]brood under the wings, and you° did not wish
[for] [it]! <sup>13:35</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Behold, your° house is left to you°
desolate and I say to you°, that you° should never
see me, until [the time] will come whenever you° say,
The one coming in the name of the Lord has been
blessed.

[Luke 14] <a id="Lk14"></a>

<sup>14:1</sup> And it happened, while* he was going into a
house of a certain [one] of the rulers of the Pharisees
on a Sabbath to eat bread, [that] they themselves were
observing him. <sup>14:2</sup> And behold, there was before him,
a certain man [with] dropsy. <sup>14:3</sup> And Jesus answered
[and] spoke to the professors of the law and Pharisees,
saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">If it is [not]  legal to heal on the Sabbath,
[then]? <sup>14:4</sup> But they were quiet. And he grabbed him
and healed and dismissed [him]. <sup>14:5</sup> And he answered
[and] said to them, Of which one of you° will a son or
a bull fall into a well, and he will not be immediately
pulling him up on the Sabbath day? <sup>14:6</sup> And they
were not strong-enough to answer back to him [as] to
these things.

<sup>14:7</sup> Now he spoke a parable to the ones who have
been invited, [while] taking-heed how they were
choosing for themselves the foremost-places; saying
to them: <sup>14:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Whenever you might be invited by
anyone to a marriage-festivities, do not recline in
the foremost-place; [because] maybe a [more]
admired one [than] you may be invited by him,  <sup>14:9</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">and the one who invited you and him, [when] he has
come, will say to you, Give this one [your] place,
and then you may begin with shame to hold the
last place. <sup>14:10</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But whenever you might be invited,
[after] traveling [there], lean-back in the last place;
in-order-that whenever he who has invited you
comes, he might say to you, Friend, advance
upward, [and] then it will be glory in the sight of
the ones who recline [at the table] together-with
you. <sup>14:11</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> Because everyone [who is] exalting himself
will be humbled, and the one humbling himself
will be exalted.

<sup>14:12</sup> Now he was also saying to the one who
invited him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Whenever you make<span style="font-weight: bold">* a meal or a
supper, do not summon your friends, nor your
brethren, nor your relatives, nor rich neighbors;
lest they may also invite you too and it might
become a repayment for you. <sup>14:13</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  But whenever
you make*<span style="font-weight: bold"> a banquet, invite the poor, the
disabled, the lame, the blind; <sup>14:14</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and you will be
fortunate, because they do not have [anything in
which] to repay you; for* you will be repaid in the
resurrection of the righteous.


<sup>14:15</sup> Now [after] someone from the ones [who are
]reclining [at the meal] together-with [him] heard these
things, he said to him, Who[ever] will be eating a meal
in the kingdom of God [is] fortunate.
<sup>14:16</sup> But he said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">A certain man made*<span style="font-weight: bold"> a
great supper, and he invited many; <sup>14:17</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and he
sent forth his bondservant in the hour of the
supper to say to the ones who have been invited,
Come°<span style="font-weight: bold">, because all things are already prepared.
<sup>14:18</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And they all, from one [desire], began to excuse
themselves. The first said to him, I bought a field,
and I have a necessity to go forth and to see it. I
request [of] you, have me excused!
<sup>14:19</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And a different [one] said, I bought five
yokes of bulls, and I am traveling [on] to test them.
I request [of] you, have me excused!
<sup>14:20</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And a different [one] <span style="font-weight: bold">said, I married a wife,
and because of this, I am not able to come. <sup>14:21</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">And that bondservant came*<span style="font-weight: bold"> [and] reported to his
lord these things. Then the householder was made
angry, [and] said to his bondservant, Go forth
quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and
lead the poor and disabled and lame and blind in
here.
<sup>14:22</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And the bondservant said, Lord, it has
happened as you commanded, and a place is still<span style="font-weight: bold">
[empty]. <sup></sup>
<sup>14:23</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And the lord said to the bondservant, Go
forth into the roads and [over the] fences, and urge
[them] to enter, in-order-that my house may be
filled. <sup>14:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* I am saying to you°, that none of
those men who have been invited will be tasting of
my supper. For* <span style="font-weight: bold">many are invited but few chosen.


<sup>14:25</sup> Now large crowds were traveling together-with him and he turned and said to them, <sup>14:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">If
anyone comes to me and does not hate his father
and mother and wife and children and brethren
and sisters, and also, still his [own] life, he is not
able to be my disciple.  <sup>14:27</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And who[ever] does not
bear his own cross, and comes after me, is not
able to be my disciple.
<sup>14:28</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* who out-of you°, wishing to build a
tower, has not first sat [down and] calculate the
cost, if he has the [means] toward [its] realization?
<sup>14:29</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Lest that*, having <span style="font-weight: bold">laid a foundation, and not
being strong-enough to complete, all who view [it]
may begin to mock him, <sup>14:30</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">saying, This man
began to build and was not strong-enough to
complete.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>14:31<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">Or what king, [while] traveling to confront<span style="font-weight: bold"> a
different king in war, [has] not sat [down ]first [and]
plan if he is able at ten thousand to encounter the
one who is coming against him with twenty
thousand? <sup>14:32</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold"> Otherwise, having sent an
emissary, <span style="font-weight: bold">[while] still being faraway, he asks for the
[terms] pertaining to peace. <sup>14:33</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, so
everyone out-of you° who is not bidding farewell
to all his own possessions, he is not able to be my
disciple. <sup>14:34</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The salt [is] good, but if the salt is
flavorless, in what will it be seasoned<span style="font-weight: bold">? <sup>14:35<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">It is fit
neither *for the soil nor *for the manure-pile. Cast
it outside. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

[Luke 15] <a id="Lk15"></a>

<sup>15:1</sup> Now all the tax collectors and sinners were
drawing near to him to hear him. <sup>15:2</sup> And the
Pharisees and the scribes were murmuring, saying,
This [man  ]accepts sinners and eats together-with
them.

<sup>15:3</sup> Now he spoke to them this parable, saying: <sup>15:4</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What man out-of you°, having a hundred sheep
and having lost one out-of them, does not leave
the ninety-nine in the wilderness and travel to
what he has lost, until he should find it? <sup>15:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And
having found [it], he places [it] upon his shoulders,
rejoicing. <sup>15:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And [after]<span style="font-weight: bold"> he went to the house [of his],
he calls together the friends and the neighbors,
saying to them, Rejoice° together-with me, because
I found my sheep, the one which had lost [its way].
<sup>15:7</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  I say to you° thus, that there will be joy in
heaven over one repenting sinner, [more] than over
ninety-nine righteous [ones], who have no need of
repentance.
<sup>15:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Or what woman having ten two-denarii-coins, if she loses one two-denarii-coin, does not
light a lamp and sweep the house, and seek
carefully until which [time] she should find [it]? <sup>15:9</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">And having found [it], she calls together the friends
and the neighbors, [she has], saying, Rejoice<span style="font-weight: bold">°
together-with me, because I found the two-denarii-coin which I lost. <sup>15:10</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">So, I say to you°, It
becomes joy in the sight of the messengers of God
over one repenting sinner.

<sup>15:11</sup> Now he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">A certain man had two sons.
<sup>15:12</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And the younger of them said to [his] father,
Father, give to me the part of the estate [that would
be] put [toward me]. And he sectioned [off his
]livelihood to them. <sup>15:13</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And not many days after,
the younger son gathered [it] all together [and] went-abroad into a far region, and he squandered his
estate with riotous living there. <sup>15:14</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  Now having
spent all, a mighty famine<span style="font-weight: bold"> happened throughout
that region, and he began to come-short [of money].
<sup>15:15</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And traveling [away], he joined himself to one
of the citizens of that region, and he sent him into
his fields to feed swine. <sup>15:16</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And he was desiring to
fill his belly from the carob pods of which the
swine were eating, and no one was giving [anything]
to him. <sup>15:17</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now [after]<span style="font-weight: bold">[ ]he came to himself, he said,
How-many of my father’s hired [servants] are
abounding, [even] of bread? But I am perishing
[here] in famine! <sup>15:18</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">[When ]I have risen*<span style="font-weight: bold"> up, I will
be traveling to my father, and will say to him,
Father, I sinned at heaven, and in your sight. <sup>15:19</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">And I am no more worthy to be called your son.
Make*<span style="font-weight: bold"> me like one of your hired [servants.] <sup>15:20</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And
having stood up, he came to his father. 
<span style="font-weight: bold">But [while] being <span style="font-weight: bold">still distant, far from [him], his
father saw him and had compassion, and ran and
fell upon his neck and kissed him. <sup>15:21</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But the son
said to him, Father, I sinned at heaven, and in
your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called
your son.
<sup>15:22</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But the father said to his bondservants,
Bring<span style="font-weight: bold">° out the foremost robe and clothe° him, and
give° [him] a ring *for his hand and shoes *for the
feet; <sup>15:23</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and [after]<span style="font-weight: bold"> you° [have] brought the fattened
calf, sacrifice° [it], and [after] we [have] eaten [it,] we
should be joyous. <sup>15:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Because this [one], my son,
was dead and [then] lived again, and lost and [then]
was found. And they began to be joyous.  <sup>15:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now
his elder son was in the field and as [while ]coming,
he drew near to the house, [and] he heard harmony
and dancers. <sup>15:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And having called one of the
young-servants, he was inquiring what these
things might be.
<sup>15:27</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But he said to him, Your brother is coming,
and your father sacrificed the fattened calf
because he [has] received him [back] healthy. <sup>15:28</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But
he was made angry and was not willing to enter
and therefore his father went forth [and] was
pleading him.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>15:29</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But he answered [and] said to [his] father,
Behold, I [did] serve* you [for] so-many years, <span style="font-weight: bold">and I
never transgressed a commandment from you,
and [yet] you never gave me a young-goat, in-order-that I might be joyous with my friends. <sup>15:30</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But
when this [one], your son came, who devoured your
livelihood with prostitutes, you sacrificed the
fattened calf for him.
<sup>15:31</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now he said to him, Child, you are always
with me, and all the things [which are] mine are
yours. <sup>15:32</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But it was essential to be joyous and
rejoice, because this [one], your brother was dead,
and [then] lived again, and lost and [then] was found.

[Luke 16] <a id="Lk16"></a>

<sup>16:1</sup> Now he also said to his disciples, <span style="font-weight: bold">There was
a certain rich man, who had a steward, and this
one was indicted by him as [one] squandering his
possessions. <sup>16:2</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And having summoned him, he
said to him, What [is] this thing [which] I am hearing
concerning you? Give [me] the account of your
stewardship; for* you will not still be able to be a
steward<span style="font-weight: bold">.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>16:3</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But the steward said in himself, What
should I do*<span style="font-weight: bold">, because my lord is taking away the
stewardship from me? I am not strong-enough to
dig; I am ashamed to beg. <sup>16:4</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">I have known what
I should be doing*, in-order-that whenever I
should be removed [from] the stewardship, they
may accept me into their houses. <sup>16:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And having
called [to him ]each one of his lord’s debtors, he
said to the first, How-much do you owe to my
lord?
<sup>16:6</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now he said, A hundred <span style="font-weight: bold">eight-gallon-containers of oil.
<span style="font-weight: bold">And he said to him, Accept your <span style="font-weight: bold">writing {i.e.
contract}<span style="font-weight: bold"> and [after] you [have] sat [down], quickly write
fifty.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>16:7</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Thereafter, he said to a different [one], and
how-much do you owe?
<span style="font-weight: bold">Now he said, A hundred twelve-bushel-containers of grain.
<span style="font-weight: bold">And he says to him, Accept your <span style="font-weight: bold">writing {i.e.
contract} <span style="font-weight: bold">and write eighty.
<sup>16:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And [his] lord praised the steward of
unrighteousness because he did*  prudently,
because the sons of this world are [more] prudent to
their [own] generation; [even] beyond the sons of the
light.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>16:9</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And I say to you°, Make*&#176;<span style="font-weight: bold"> friends for
yourselves out-of the money of unrighteousness;
in-order-that, whenever you° fail, they may accept
you° into the everlasting tabernacles. <sup>16:10</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The
faithful in [the] least [matters] is also faithful in
much, and the unrighteous in [the] least [matters] is
also unrighteous in much. <sup>16:11</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, if you°
did not become faithful in the unrighteous money,
who will be entrusting the true* [riches] to you°? <sup>16:12</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">And if you° did not become faithful in what [is]
another’s, who will be giving you° what [is] yours°?
<sup>16:13</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">No domestic [servant] is able to serve* two lords;
for* either he will hate the one and will love* the
other; or he will hold to one and despise the other.
You° are not able to serve* God and money.

<sup>16:14</sup> Now the Pharisees, who are* money-lovers,
were also hearing all these things, and they were
ridiculing him. <sup>16:15</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">You° are
the ones [who are ]making yourselves righteous in
the sight of men, but God knows your° hearts,
because the thing exalted among men [is] an
abomination in God’s sight.
<sup>16:16</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The law and the prophets [were] until John;
from then the good-news of the kingdom of God
is proclaimed, and everyone violently-enters into
it. <sup>16:17</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But it is easier [for] the heaven and the earth
to <span style="font-weight: bold">pass away, than [for] one serif of the law to fall
short. <sup>16:18</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Everyone who divorces his wife and
marries a different [one] <span style="font-weight: bold">is committing adultery,
and everyone who marries the one who has been
divorced from a husband, is committing adultery.


<sup>16:19</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now there was a certain rich man and he
was clothing himself in purple and fine-linen,
being radiantly joyous daily. <sup>16:20</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now there was a
certain poor [man,] Lazarus<span style="font-weight: bold"> by name, who had
been put before his gate, having been full of sores,
<sup>16:21</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and desiring to be fully-fed from the falling
crumbs of the rich [man’s] table. But even the dogs,
coming [to him], were licking his sores. <sup></sup>

<sup>16:22</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  Now it happened [for] the poor [man] to die
and [for] him to be carried away by the messengers
into Abraham’s bosom, and the rich [man] also
died and was buried. <sup>16:23</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  And having lifted up his
eyes in Hades<span style="font-weight: bold">, being* in torments, he sees
Abraham from afar, and Lazarus at his bosoms.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>16:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Who, having shouted, he said, Father
Abraham, show-mercy to me, and send Lazarus
in-order-that he may dip the tip of his finger in
water and may cool my tongue, because I am in
anguish in this flame.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>16:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But Abraham said, Child, remember that
you received your good things in your life and
Lazarus likewise evil things, but now he is
comforted here and you are in anguish. <sup>16:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And
over all these things, a great chasm has been
established between us and you°, *that the ones
who wish to cross over from here to you° may not
be able, nor may they ferry over from there to us.
<sup>16:27</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But he said, Therefore father<span style="font-weight: bold">, I am requesting
[him] in-order-that you should send him to my
father’s house; <sup>16:28</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">for* I have five brethren; *that
he may thoroughly testify to them, in-order-that
they may not even <span style="font-weight: bold">come into this place of torment.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>16:29</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Abraham says to him, They have Moses
and the prophets. Let°<span style="font-weight: bold"> them hear them.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>16:30</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But he said, No, father Abraham, but if
someone travels to them from the dead, they will
be repenting.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>16:31</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But he said to him, If they do not hear
Moses and the prophets, neither will they be
persuaded, if someone rises* up from the dead.

[Luke 17] <a id="Lk17"></a>

<sup>17:1</sup> Now he said to the disciples, <span style="font-weight: bold">It is inevitable
[for  ]offenses not to come, but woe [to him], through
whom they come! <sup>17:2</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">It is beneficial for him if a
millstone rotated by a donkey encompassed
around his neck, and he has been tossed into the
sea, [rather] than that* he should offend one of these
little ones.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>17:3</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Take-heed<span style="font-weight: bold">° to yourselves; and if your
brother sins at <span style="font-weight: bold"> you, rebuke him, and if
he repents, forgive him. <sup>17:4</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And if he <span style="font-weight: bold">sins at {i.e.
against}<span style="font-weight: bold"> you seven-times [in] the day, and should
return seven-times [in] the day, saying, I repent.
You will be forgiving him.

<sup>17:5</sup> And the apostles said to the Lord, Add [more]
faith to us<span style="font-weight: bold">.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>17:6</sup> Now the Lord said, <span style="font-weight: bold">If you° have faith like a
kernel of a mustard-seed, you° would have spoken
to this mulberry fig tree, Be uprooted and be
planted in the sea, and it would have obeyed* you°.
<sup>17:7</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But who out-of you°, having a bondservant
plowing or shepherding, will immediately <span style="font-weight: bold">say [to
him], [after] he entered [in] from the field, [After] he
[has] passed beside [you], lean-back [at the table.] <sup>17:8</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">But will he not [rather] say to him, Prepare what I
may dine [on]. And having girded yourself, serve
me, until I eat and drink and you may eat and
may drink after these things. <sup>17:9</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">He does not have
gratitude to that bondservant because he did*  the
things which were commanded [him], does he? I
think not. <sup>17:10</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">So also you°, whenever you° do*<span style="font-weight: bold"> all
the things which were  commanded to you°, say<span style="font-weight: bold">°,
We are useless bondservants, because we have
done* what we ought to do.


<sup>17:11</sup> And it happened, while* he was traveling to
Jerusalem, even he was going through [the] middle of
Samaria and Galilee. <sup>17:12</sup> And [while] entering into a
certain village, ten men [who are] lepers encountered
him [there], who stood farther out; <sup>17:13</sup> and they
themselves lifted [up] [their ]voice, saying, Jesus,
Master*, show-mercy [on] us.
<sup>17:14</sup> And having seen them, he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">[After]
<span style="font-weight: bold">traveling [back], show° yourselves to the priests.
And it happened, while* they were proceeding
away, they were cleansed. <sup>17:15</sup> Now one out-of them,
having seen that he was healed, returned with a loud
voice, glorifying God; <sup>17:16</sup> and he fell upon his face
beside his feet, giving-thanks to him, and he was a
Samaritan.
<sup>17:17</sup> But Jesus answered [and] said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Were not the
ten cleansed, but where [are] the nine? <sup>17:18</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Were
not [any] found, except this immigrant, who
returned to give glory to God? <sup>17:19</sup> And he said to
him, <span style="font-weight: bold">[After] you [have] stood up, travel [on]. Your faith
has cured you.

<sup>17:20</sup> And having been asked by the Pharisees when
the kingdom of God is coming, he answered them
and said, <span style="font-weight: bold">The kingdom of God is not coming with
observation; <sup>17:21</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">nor will they say, Behold, here!
Or, behold there! For* behold, the kingdom of
God is within you°.


<sup>17:22</sup> Now he said to the disciples, <span style="font-weight: bold">The days will
be coming, when you° will desire to see one of the
days of the Son of Man, and you° will not see [it].
<sup>17:23</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And they will say to you°, Behold here! Or
behold there! Do<span style="font-weight: bold">° not go away, nor pursue [them].
<sup>17:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* just-like the lightning, which flashes from
the [one end] under heaven, [and] shines to the [other
end] under heaven; so will the Son of Man be in his
day. <sup>17:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But first <span style="font-weight: bold">it is essential [for] him to suffer
many things and to be rejected* away from this
generation. <sup>17:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And just-as it happened in the
days of Noah, so it will also be in the days of the
Son of Man. <sup>17:27</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">They were eating; they were
drinking; they were marrying; they were being
betrothed, till which day [that] Noah entered into
the ark, and the flood came and destroyed [them]
all. <sup>17:28</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  Likewise, even as it happened in the days
of Lot; they were eating; they were drinking; they
were buying; they were selling; they were
planting; they were building; <sup>17:29</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">but in the day
which Lot went forth from Sodom, it rained fire
and brimstone from heaven and destroyed [them]
all. <sup>17:30</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">According-to these things, it will be in the
day which the Son of Man is revealed. <sup>17:31</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">He who
will be upon the housetop in that day, <span style="font-weight: bold">and [has] his
goods in the house, let him not go-down to take
them up, and the one [who is ]in the field, likewise.
let him not turn behind [for them]. <sup>17:32</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Remember<span style="font-weight: bold">°
Lot’s wife.  <span style="font-weight: bold"> <sup>17:33</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Whoever should seek to
save his life will be losing it, and whoever loses [it]
will be preserving [it]. <sup>17:34</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">I say to you°, There will
be two  upon one bed in this night; the one will be
taken and the other [one] will be left.  <sup>17:35</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Two will
be grinding at the same [place]; the one will be
taken and the other [one] will be left. <sup>17:36</sup> <sup></sup> [<span style="font-weight: bold">There
will be two in the field; the one will be taken and
the other one will be left.]
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>17:37</sup> And they answered [and] say to him, Where,
Lord?
Now he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Where the body [is], the
vultures will also be gathered together there.

[Luke 18] <a id="Lk18"></a>

<sup>18:1</sup> Now he also spoke a parable to them, *that* it
is essential to always pray, and not to be depressed;
<sup>18:2</sup> saying: <span style="font-weight: bold">A certain judge was in a certain city,
[who was] not fearing God and not revering man.
<sup>18:3</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now a widow was in that city, and she was
coming[ often ]to him, saying, Avenge me from my
opponent. <sup>18:4</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And he did not wish to at [that] time,
but after these things [continued], he said in
himself, Even if I do not fear God, and I do not
revere man; <sup>18:5</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">yet because this widow is
harassing me, I will avenge her, in-order-that she
may not pester me, coming [often] *for an end [of her
opponent].
<sup>18:6</sup> But the Lord said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Hear<span style="font-weight: bold">° [with understanding]
what the judge of the unrighteousness <span style="font-weight: bold">says [about
himself].

<sup>18:7</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now, should God not do* the avenging of his
chosen the ones crying to him day and night?
Also, [should he not] have patience <span style="font-weight: bold">upon them?
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>18:8</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">I say to you°, that he will be doing*  the
avenging on them quickly.
<span style="font-weight: bold">However, [when] <span style="font-weight: bold">the Son of Man has come, will
he then be finding the faith upon the earth?

<sup>18:9</sup> Now he spoke this parable to some who have
confidence in themselves, that they are righteous, and
scorning the rest: <sup>18:10</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Two men went-up into the
temple to pray; the [first] one a Pharisee and the
other a tax collector. <sup>18:11</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">The Pharisee stood with
<span style="font-weight: bold"> himself,  [and] was praying these things,
God, I give-thanks to you, that I am not like the
rest of men: ravening, unrighteous ones,
adulterers or even just-like this tax collector.  <sup>18:12</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">I fast twice [in] the week; I tithe of all things, as
many things as I procure. <sup>18:13</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And the tax
collector, standing from afar, was not even willing
to lift up the eyes to heaven, but was beating at his
chest, saying, God, be lenient to me, the sinner.
<sup>18:14</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">I say to you°, This one went-down to his house,
having been made righteous [rather] than that [man].
For*<span style="font-weight: bold"> everyone who is exalting himself will be
humbled, but he who is humbling himself will be
exalted.


<sup>18:15</sup> Now they were also bringing to him their
babies, in-order-that he might touch them, but [after]
the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. <sup>18:16</sup> But
Jesus, having called them [to him], said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Allow<span style="font-weight: bold">° the
[young] children to come to me and do° not forbid
them; for* the kingdom of God is of such. <sup>18:17</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">
<span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I am saying to you°, Whoever does not
accept the kingdom of God like a [young] child, he
should never enter into it.


{Mar 10:17-31 & Mat 19:16-20:16 & Luk 18:18-30
Peraea.}
<sup>18:18</sup> And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good
Teacher, [by] having practiced what, will I inherit
everlasting life?
<sup>18:19</sup> But Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why do you call<span style="font-weight: bold">* me
good? None [is] good, except one, [our] God. <sup>18:20<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">You
know the commandments: “Do not commit
adultery. Do not murder. Do not steal. Do not
falsely testify. Honor your father and your
mother.’ 
<sup>18:21</sup> But he said, I [have] observed all these things
from my youth [up].
<sup>18:22</sup> Now having heard these things, Jesus said to
him,<span style="font-weight: bold">  One [thing] is still <span style="font-weight: bold">deficient for you. Sell all
things, as many things as you have and distribute
to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven
and come-here. Follow me. <sup>18:23</sup> But he heard these
things, [and] became very sorrowful; for* he was
extremely rich. <sup>18:24</sup> Now having seen him, Jesus
became very sorrowful, he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">How the ones who
have wealth will hardly enter into the kingdom of
God! <sup>18:25</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> For* it is easier [for] a camel to enter in
through a needle’s eye, than [for] a rich [man] to
enter into the kingdom of God.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>18:26</sup> Now the ones who heard it said, And who is
able to be saved?
<sup>18:27</sup> But he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">The things [which are] impossible
with men are possible with God.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>18:28</sup> But Peter said, Behold, we left all and
followed you.
<sup>18:29</sup> But he said to them,<span style="font-weight: bold"> Assuredly I am saying
to you°, There is no one who [has] left [his] house or
parents or brethren or wife or children, because
of the kingdom of God, <sup>18:30</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">who should not
receive much-more <span style="font-weight: bold">in this time, and in the coming
age everlasting life.

{Mar 10:32-45 & Mat 20:17-28 & Luk 18:31-34; Peraea or
Judea, near Jordan.}<span style="font-weight: bold">
<sup>18:31</sup> Now having taken the twelve and said to
them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Behold, we are going-up to Jerusalem, and
all the things which have been written through the
prophets will be completed by the Son of Man. <sup>18:32</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">For* he will be given up to the Gentiles, and will
be mocked and will be insulted and will be spat
on. <sup>18:33</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And having scourged [him], they will be
killing him, and he will be rising* up in the third
day. <sup>18:34</sup> And they understood none of these things,
and this declaration was being hidden from them, and
they did not know the things which are spoken.


<sup>18:35</sup> Now it happened, while* he was drawing near
to Jericho, a certain blind [man] was sitting beside the
road begging. <sup>18:36</sup> Now having heard a crowd
traveling through, he inquired what this might be. <sup>18:37</sup>
Now they reported to him, that Jesus the Nazarene is
passing [by]. <sup>18:38</sup> And he cried [out], saying, Jesus, son
[of] David, show-mercy [on] me. <sup>18:39</sup> And the ones who
precede were rebuking him, in-order-that he should
be silent, but he was crying out much more, Son of
David, show-mercy [on] me!
<sup>18:40</sup> Now having stopped, Jesus commanded him
to be led to him. And [after] he drew near, he asked
him, <sup>18:41</sup> saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">What do you wish [that] I might do<span style="font-weight: bold">*
for you?
<span style="font-weight: bold">But he said, Lord, that* I may recover [my] sight.
<sup>18:42</sup> And Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Recover your sight.
Your faith has cured you. <sup>18:43</sup> And instantly he
recovered his sight and was following him, glorifying
God. And all the people, having seen [it], gave praise
to God.

[Luke 19] <a id="Lk19"></a>


<sup>19:1</sup> And having entered, he was going through
Jericho. <sup>19:2</sup> And behold, a man called by [the] name
Zacchaeus [was there] and he was a chief tax collector
and this one was rich. <sup>19:3</sup> And he was seeking to see
Jesus; who he is, and was not able from the crowd,
because he was little in stature. <sup>19:4</sup> And having ran
ahead before [the crowd], he ascended [up] upon a
sycamore fig tree in-order-that he might see him,
because he was about to go through that [way]. <sup>19:5</sup> And
as he came to the place, Jesus looked up [and] saw
him, and said to him,<span style="font-weight: bold">  Zacchaeus, [after] you [have]
hurried, come-down; for* it is essential [for] me to
abide in your house today. <sup>19:6</sup> And having hurried,
he came-down and accepted him, rejoicing.
<sup>19:7</sup> And having seen it, they were all murmuring,
saying, He [has] entered to board with a man, a sinner.
<sup>19:8</sup> Now Zacchaeus stood [and] said to the Lord,
Behold, Lord, I give half of my possessions to the
poor, and if I cheated anyone of anything, I repay
[them] quadruple.
<sup>19:9</sup> Now Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Today salvation [has]
happened to this house, insomuch as he is also a
son of Abraham. <sup>19:10</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* the Son of Man came to
seek and save what has been lost.


<sup>19:11</sup> Now [while][ ]they themselves are hearing these
things, he added [and] spoke a parable, because of the
thing near to Jerusalem, and [because] they think that
the kingdom of God is about to be instantly
manifested. <sup>19:12</sup> Therefore he said: <span style="font-weight: bold">A certain noble
man, traveled into a far [away] region, to receive a
kingdom <span style="font-weight: bold">for himself and to return. <sup>19:13</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now he
called ten of his <span style="font-weight: bold">bondservants, and gave them ten
two-hundred denarii-coins, and said to them,
Trade° [with this] until I come. <sup>19:14</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But his citizens
were hating him and sent an emissary after him,
saying, We do not wish [that] this one reign over us. 
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>19:15</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And it happened, while*<span style="font-weight: bold"> he was coming
back again, having received the kingdom, and he
said, These bondservants to whom he gave the
silver, [are] to be summoned to him, in-order-that
he might know who [had] made what by trading.
<sup>19:16</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Now the first came*<span style="font-weight: bold">, saying, Lord, your
two-hundred denarii-coins [has been] worked [up to]
ten two-hundred denarii-coins more. <sup>19:17</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And he
said to him, Well [done], good bondservant, because
you became faithful in [the] least [matters]. You have
ten cities. Be [the] authority over [them]. <sup></sup>
<sup>19:18</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And the second came, saying, Your two-hundred denarii-coins, Lord, made* five two-hundred denarii-coins. <sup>19:19</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But he also said to this
one, You, become [the authority] over five cities. 
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>19:20</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And a different<span style="font-weight: bold"> [bondservant] came, saying,
Lord, behold, [here is] your two-hundred denarii-coins, which I was holding, laying [it] up in a
handkerchief; <sup>19:21</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">for* I was fearing you, because
you are an austere man. You lift up [from] what
you did not lay [down] and reap what you did not
sow.
<sup>19:22</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But he says to him, I will be judging you
out-of your [own] mouth, you evil bondservant.
You knew that I am an austere man, lifting up
[from] what I did not lay [down] and reaping what I
did not sow? <sup>19:23</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And why did you not give my
silver over [to the] bank, and [after]<span style="font-weight: bold">[ ]I came [back,] I
would have appropriated it together-with
interest?
<sup>19:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And he said to the ones standing beside
[him], Take<span style="font-weight: bold">° away the two-hundred denarii-coins
from him, and give° [it] to the one who has the ten
two-hundred denarii-coins.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>19:25</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And they said to him, Lord, he has ten two-hundred denarii-coins. [Why?]
<sup>19:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* I say to you°, that to everyone who has,
will be given, but from the one who has not, even
what he has will be taken away from him. <sup>19:27</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">However my enemies, those [men] who did not wish
[for] me to reign over them, lead<span style="font-weight: bold">° [them] here and

<sup>19:28</sup> And having said these things, he was traveling
[on] before [them], going-up to Jerusalem.

<sup>19:29</sup> And it happened, as he drew near to
Bethphage and Bethany, toward the mountain which
is called Olives, he sent two of his disciples, <sup>19:30</sup> [and]
said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Proceed<span style="font-weight: bold">° into the village in front of [me]; in
which, traveling [to it]; you° will find a young-donkey which has been tied, on which no one
from mankind [has] sat at anytime.  Having loosed
it, lead&#176; [it here]. <sup>19:31</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And if anyone asks you°, Why
are you° loosening [him]? You° will say to him thus,
The Lord has need of him. <sup>19:32</sup> Now the ones,
having been sent, went away, and found just-as he
[had] said to them.
<sup>19:33</sup> And [while] loosening the young-donkey, the
lords of it said to them, Why are you° loosening the
young-donkey?
<sup>19:34</sup> Now they said, The Lord has need of it. <sup>19:35</sup>
And they led it to Jesus, and having tossed forth their
[own] garments upon the young-donkey, they mounted
Jesus upon [it.] <sup>19:36</sup> Now [while]  traveling [there], they
were spreading their garments in the road. <sup>19:37</sup> Now
[as he was] already drawing near, [even] to the slope of
the Mountain of Olives, all the multitude of the
disciples began rejoicing, [and] to praise God with a
loud voice concerning all the miracles which they
saw; <sup>19:38</sup> saying, The King, the one coming in the
name of the Lord has been blessed; peace in heaven
and glory in the highest.
<sup>19:39</sup> And some of the Pharisees from the crowd
said to him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples.
<sup>19:40</sup> And he answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">I say to
you°, that if these [disciples] should be silent, [then]
the stones will be crying out.

<sup>19:41</sup> And as he drew near, having seen the city, he
wept over it, <sup>19:42</sup> saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">If you knew in this day,
even you, for-sure, the things [which are] for your
peace! But now they were hidden from your eyes.
<sup>19:43</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Because [the] days will be coming upon you,
and your enemies will put a military-barrier
around you and will surround you, and will be
crowding you together on every-side, <sup>19:44</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and will
be leveling you to the bedrock, and your children
among you, and they will not be leaving in you

know the time of your visitation.

<sup>19:45</sup> And having entered into the temple, he began
to cast forth the ones selling and buying in it, <sup>19:46</sup>
saying to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">It has been written, 'My house is a
house of prayer, but you° made*<span style="font-weight: bold"> it a den of

teaching daily in the temple. But the high-priests and

seeking to destroy him. <sup>19:48</sup> And they were not
finding what they might do*; for* the people were all
hanging [on] him, listening.

[Luke 20] <a id="Lk20"></a>

{Mar 11:27-33 & Mat 21:23-27 & Luk 20:1-8 Courtyard of
the Temple, Tues.}
<sup>20:1</sup> And it happened on one of those days, [while] he
himself is teaching the people in the temple and
proclaiming the good-news, the priests and the
scribes, together-with the elders stood by; <sup>20:2</sup> and
they spoke to him, saying, Tell us, by what authority
are you doing*  these things? Or who is he who gave
you this authority?
<sup>20:3</sup> But he answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">I will also
ask you° one <span style="font-weight: bold">question, and tell<span style="font-weight: bold">° me. <sup>20:4<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">The
immersion*<span style="font-weight: bold"> of John, was it from heaven or from
men?
<sup>20:5</sup> Now they reasoned with themselves, saying, If
we should say, From heaven; he will say, Why did
you° not believe him? <sup>20:6</sup> But if we should say, From
men; all the people will be stoning us; for* they have
confidence [that] John is a prophet. <sup>20:7</sup> And they
answered [claiming] not to know from where.
<sup>20:8</sup> And Jesus said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Neither do I tell you°
by what authority I am doing*  these things.


<sup>20:9</sup> Now he began to speak to the people this
parable:<span style="font-weight: bold">  A man planted a vineyard and rented it
out to farmers, and went-abroad for considerable
times <span style="font-weight: bold">. <sup>20:10</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And he sent out a
bondservant in the [harvest] season to the farmers,
in-order-that they might give to him from the
fruit of the vineyard, but the farmers whipped
him and sent [him] away empty [handed]. <sup>20:11</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And he
added a different bondservant to send, and they
also whipped and dishonored [him], and sent [him]
out empty. <sup>20:12</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And he added a third to send, and
they also traumatized this one and cast [him] forth. 
<sup>20:13</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But the lord of the vineyard said, What
should I do*? I will be sending my beloved son;
perchance [when] they have seen this one, they will
revere [him]. <sup>20:14</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But [after] the farmers saw him,
they were reasoning with themselves, saying, This
is the heir. Come-here°. We should kill him, in-order-that the inheritance may become ours. <sup>20:15</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">And having cast him forth, outside the vineyard,
they killed [him]. Therefore, what will the lord of
the vineyard do* to them? <sup>20:16</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">He will be coming
and will be destroying these farmers, and will be
giving the vineyard to others.
But having heard [this], they said, Let it not happen!
<sup>20:17</sup> But he looked at them and said,<span style="font-weight: bold"> Therefore
what is this which has been written, “The stone
which the builders rejected*, this one became the
head of the corner'?  <sup>20:18</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Everyone who
[has] fallen upon that stone will be shattered, but
upon whomever it falls, it will be smashing him.
<sup>20:19</sup> And the high-priests and the scribes sought to
put hands upon him in the same hour and [yet] they
feared [the people]; for* they knew that he spoke this
parable to them.

{Mar 12:13-17 & Mat 22:15-22 & Luk 20:20-26 Courtyard
of the Temple, Tues.}
<sup>20:20</sup> And having observed [him], they sent forth
agents, who themselves pretend to be righteous, in-order-that they might grab him from his speech, *that*
they might give him to the rule and the authority of
the governor. <sup>20:21</sup> And they asked him, saying,
Teacher, we know that you say and teach correctly,
and you do not receive the countenance [of men], but
in truth, are teaching the way of God. <sup>20:22</sup> Is it legal
for us to give tax to Caesar or not?
<sup>20:23</sup> But he perceived their craftiness and said to
them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why are you° testing me? <sup>20:24</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Show<span style="font-weight: bold">° me a
denarius. Whose image and inscription has it?
But they answered [and] said, Caesar’s.

<sup>20:25</sup> But he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Now-then, give<span style="font-weight: bold">° to
Caesar the things [which are] Caesar’s, and to God
the things [which are] God’s. <sup>20:26</sup> And they were not
strong-enough to grasp his declaration in front of the
people, and they marveled at his answer [and] were
silent.


<sup>20:27</sup> Now some of the Sadducees came near, the
ones who contradict, [saying] no resurrection [is] to be;
they asked him, <sup>20:28</sup> saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to
us, in-order-that if anyone’s brother dies, having a
wife, and this one should die childless, his brother
should take the wife and should raise* up seed to his
brother.  <sup>20:29</sup> Therefore, seven brothers
were [with us], and the first took a wife [and] died
childless; <sup>20:30</sup> and the second took the woman and
this one died childless; <sup>20:31</sup> and likewise* the third
took her, and likewise* the seven also left no children
and they [all] died. <sup>20:32</sup> But after  all things, the woman
also died. <sup>20:33</sup> Therefore in the resurrection, whose
wife of them does she become? For* the seven had
her [as] wife.
<sup>20:34</sup> And Jesus answered [and] said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">The
sons of this world marry and are betrothed. <sup>20:35</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">But the ones who were deemed worthy to obtain
that world and the resurrection from the dead,
neither marry, nor are they betrothed, <sup>20:36</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">for*
neither are they able to die anymore; for* they are
equal to the messengers, and are sons of God,
being sons of the resurrection. <sup>20:37</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But that the
dead are raised, even Moses divulged at  the bush,
as he calls<span style="font-weight: bold">* the Lord, the God of Abraham and the
God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. <span style="font-weight: bold"> <sup>20:38</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the
living; for* all live to him.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>20:39</sup> But some of the scribes answered [and] said,
Teacher, you said well.

<sup>20:40</sup> But they were not daring anymore to ask him
anything.


<sup>20:41</sup> Now he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">How [is it that] they say
the Christ is David’s son? <sup>20:42</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And David himself
says in the book of Psalms, “The Lord said to my
Lord, Sit at my right [hand], <sup>20:43<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">until I should place
your enemies <span style="font-weight: bold">[as the] footstool of your feet. {Psa

how is he his son?
{Mar 12:38-40 & Mat 23:1-39 & Luk 20:45-47 Courts of
the Temple, Tues.}
<sup>20:45</sup> But [while] all the people [were] listening, he
said to his disciples, <sup>20:46</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Take-heed<span style="font-weight: bold">°, [stay] away
from the scribes, who wish to walk in [long] robes
and love greetings in the marketplaces and
foremost seats in the synagogues and foremost-places in the suppers; <sup>20:47</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">who are devouring
widows' houses, and are praying long [prayers] for
a pretext. These will be receiving even-more

<sup>21:1</sup> Now he looked up and saw the rich [men]
casting their gifts into the treasury. <sup>21:2</sup> But he also
saw a certain poor widow casting two bronze-coins
[in] there. <sup>21:3</sup> And he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Truly I say to you°, This
poor widow cast [in] more-than [they] all. <sup>21:4</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* all
these cast into the gifts of God out-of what is
abounding to them, but this one cast in out-of her
lacking, all the livelihood which she had.

<sup>21:5</sup> And [while] some [are] speaking concerning the
temple, that it has been adorned with beautiful stones

<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>21:10</sup> Then he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Nation will be raised

to the householder of the house, The Teacher says
to you, Where is the guestroom, where I may eat
the Passover with my disciples? <sup>22:12</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  And he will
show you° a big furnished upper-room. Prepare<span style="font-weight: bold">°
[it] there. <sup>22:13</sup> Now they went and found just-as he has
said to them, and they prepared the Passover.

<sup>22:14</sup> And when the hour came*, he leaned-back,
and the twelve apostles together-with him. <sup>22:15</sup> And
he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">I desired with [a great] desire, to eat
this Passover with you° before the [time is for] me to
suffer; <sup>22:16</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">for* I say to you°, I should never eat
from it anymore, until which [time] it should be
fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
<sup>22:17</sup> And having accepted a cup, [and] having given-thanks, he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Take<span style="font-weight: bold">° this and divide° [it] with
yourselves. <sup>22:18</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">For* I say to you°, I should never
drink from the fruit<span style="font-weight: bold">* of the vine, until which [time]
the kingdom of God should come.
{Mar 14:22-25 & Mat 26:26-29 & Luk 22:19-20, 1Co
11:23-26.}
<sup>22:19</sup> And having took bread [and] having given-thanks, he broke it and gave to them, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">This is
my body which is given on your°<span style="font-weight: bold"> behalf. Practice°
this in my remembrance. <sup>22:20</sup> And likewise*, [he took]
the cup after they dined, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">This cup [is] the new
covenant* in my blood, which is poured out on
your°<span style="font-weight: bold"> behalf.

{Mar 14:18-21, 14:27-31 & Mat 26:21-25, 26:31-35 & Luk
22:21-23, 22:31-38 & Joh 13:21-38.}
<sup>22:21<span style="font-weight: bold"> </sup><span style="font-weight: bold">However behold, the hand of the one [who is
]giving me up [is] with me at the table. <sup>22:22</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">And the
Son of Man indeed is traveling [on], according-to
what has been determined; however, woe to that
man through whom he is given up! <sup>22:23</sup> And they
began to debate together-with themselves, who then
it might be out-of them who is about to do* this thing.


<sup>22:24</sup> Now it happened [to be] also contention among
them, who of them is thinking [of himself ] to be [the]
greater. <sup>22:25</sup> But he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">The kings of the
Gentiles have lordship over them, and the ones
who have authority over them are called
benefactors. <sup>22:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But not so [with] you°, but the
greater [one] among you°, let him become like the
younger, and the leader, as the one serving. <sup>22:27</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">For* who [is the] greater one, he who reclines [at the
meal], or the one serving? [Is it ]not the one
reclining? But I am in your° midst like the one
serving. <sup>22:28</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">But you° are the ones who have
remained with me in my temptations <span style="font-weight: bold">; <sup>22:29</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">and I also covenant* to you°, just-as my father
covenanted*<span style="font-weight: bold"> to me a kingdom, <sup>22:30</sup><span style="font-weight: bold"> in-order-that
you° may eat and may drink upon my table, and
you° will be sitting upon thrones judging the
twelve tribes of Israel.


<sup>22:31</sup> Now the Lord said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Simon, Simon, behold,
the Adversary asked for you°<span style="font-weight: bold">, to sift [you°] like
wheat. <sup>22:32</sup><span style="font-weight: bold">  But I have besought concerning you,
in-order-that your faith should not fail, and
someday having turned [back] again, establish your
brethren.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>22:33</sup> But he said to him, Lord, I am ready to travel
with you both to prison and to death.
<sup>22:34</sup> But he said, <span style="font-weight: bold">I tell you Peter, The rooster
should never crow today, before you will be
denying to know me three-times.

<sup>22:35</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">When I sent you° forth
without money-bag and knapsack and shoes, you°
did not lack anything, did you°?
And they said, Nothing.
<sup>22:36</sup> Therefore he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">But now, he who
has a money-bag, let him take it and likewise a
knapsack, and he who has no sword, he will be
selling his garment and will be buying one. <sup>22:37</sup>
<span style="font-weight: bold">For* I say to you°, that it is essential [for] this to still
<span style="font-weight: bold">be completed in me, which has been written, “And
he was counted with [the] lawless'; for* [it is essential]
the things concerning me have an end. 
<sup>22:38</sup> But they said, Lord, behold, here are two
swords.
Now he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">It is sufficient.

{Mar 14:26, 14:32-42 & Mat 26:30, 26:36-46 & Luk 22:39-46 & Joh 18:1 Garden between Stream of Kidron and Mountain
of Olives, Late Thur. night.}
<sup>22:39</sup> And having gone forth and according-to his
custom, he traveled to the Mountain of Olives, and
his disciples also followed him. <sup>22:40</sup> Now [after][ ]he
came* upon the place, he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Pray° [for you°]
not to enter into temptation. <sup>22:41</sup> And he pulled
away from them approximately a stone’s throw, and
having placed [himself on] [his] knees, he was praying,
<sup>22:42</sup> saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">Father, if you are willing to carry this
cup away from me, however not my will, but let
yours happen. <sup>22:43</sup> Now a messenger from heaven
was seen by him, strengthening him. <sup>22:44</sup> And [after ]
he became in agony, he was praying more intensely,
and his sweat became like thick drops of blood
going-down upon the soil. <sup>22:45</sup> And having stood up
from [his] prayer, he came to the disciples [and] found
them, fallen-asleep from sorrow, <sup>22:46</sup> and said to
them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why are you° sleeping? [After] you° [have]
risen* up, pray°, in-order-that you° may not enter
into temptation.

{Mar 14:43-52 & Mat 26:47-56 & Luk 22:47-53 & Joh
18:2-11 Gethsemane, Fri. a few hours before dawn.}
<sup>22:47</sup> [While] he is still speaking, behold, a crowd and
the one called* Judas, one of the twelve, was going
before them, and he drew near to Jesus to kiss him.
<sup>22:48</sup> But Jesus said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Judas, are you giving up
the Son of Man with a kiss?
<sup>22:49</sup> Now [after] the ones around him, saw what will
be [coming], they said to him, Lord, If we will[ not]
strike with* the sword, [then]? <sup>22:50</sup> And a certain one
out-of them struck the bondservant of the high-priest
and took off his right ear.
<sup>22:51</sup> But Jesus answered [and] said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Permit<span style="font-weight: bold">° insofar
as this. And he touched his ear and healed him.
<sup>22:52</sup> Now Jesus said to the high-priests and
magistrates of the temple and elders, who came*
against him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Did you° come forth with swords and
clubs, like against a robber? <sup>22:53</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">[In] my being <span style="font-weight: bold">with
you° daily in the temple, you° did not stretch out
your° hands against me, but this is your° hour and
the authority of darkness.

{Mar 14:53 & Mat 26:57 & Luk 22:54a & Joh 18:24 Palace
of Caiaphas, before dawn.}
<sup>22:54</sup> But having taken him, they led [him away] and
[then] led him into the house of the high-priest.
{Mar 14:54 & Mat 26:58 & Luk 22:54b-62 & Joh 18:15-18
Courtyard of High Priest’s residence, Fri. around dawn.}
But Peter was following from afar.
{Mar 14:66-72 & Mat 26:69-75 & Luk 22:55-62 & Joh
18:25-27.}
<sup>22:55</sup> Now having lit a fire in the middle of the
courtyard and [all] having sat [down] together, Peter was
sitting in the midst of them. <sup>22:56</sup> But a certain
maidservant [after] she saw him sitting in the light [of
the fire,] and having stared at him, said, This one was
also together-with him.
<sup>22:57</sup> But he denied him, saying, Woman, I do not
know him. <sup>22:58</sup> And after a [little] bit, a different [one]
saw him, and was saying, You also are [one] out-of
them.
But Peter said, Man, I am not.
<sup>22:59</sup> And [after] approximately a one hour interval,
[then] a certain other was stoutly affirming, saying,
This one was also with him in truth; for* he is a
Galilean.
<sup>22:60</sup> But Peter said, Man, I do not know what you
are saying. And instantly, [while][ ]he[ is] still speaking,
[the] rooster crowed. <sup>22:61</sup> And the Lord turned [and]
looked at Peter. And Peter was reminded [of] the word
of the Lord, how that he said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Before the
rooster [is] to crow, you will be denying me three-times. <sup>22:62</sup> And having gone outside, Peter wept
bitterly.


<sup>22:63</sup> And the men holding Jesus were mocking
him, whipping [him]. <sup>22:64</sup> And having covered him,
they were beating his face, and asked him, saying,
Prophesy. Who is it who struck you? <sup>22:65</sup> And they
were saying many other things to him, blaspheming.

{Mar 15:1 & Mat 27:1-2 Luk 22:66-23:1 Joh 18:28a
Jerusalem early Fri. morning.}
<sup>22:66</sup> And as it became day, the eldership of the
people were gathered together, both high-priests and
scribes, and they led him up into their council,
saying, <sup>22:67</sup> If you are the Christ, tell us.
But he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">If I tell you°, you° should
never believe; <sup>22:68</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">and if I should also ask, you°
should never answer me or[ ]should [ever] release [me].
<sup>22:69</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">From hereafter, the Son of Man will be seated
at [the] right [hand] of the power of God.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>22:70</sup> Now they all said, Therefore are you the Son
of God?
But he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">You° are saying that I am.
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>22:71</sup> Now they said, Why do we still have need of
testimony? For* we ourselves heard [this] from his [own]
mouth.

[Luke 23] <a id="Lk23"></a>

<sup>23:1</sup> And all the multitude of them, having stood
up, led him in front of Pilate.

<sup>23:2</sup> Now they began to accuse him, saying, We
found this one perverting the nation and forbidding
to give taxes  to Caesar, and saying himself to be a
Christ, a king.
<sup>23:3</sup> But Pilate asked him, saying, Are you the King
of the Jews?
Now he answered [and] said to him, <span style="font-weight: bold">You say
[correctly].
<span style="font-weight: bold"><sup>23:4</sup> Now Pilate said to the high-priests and the
crowds, I am finding no crime in this man.
<sup>23:5</sup> But they were insisting, saying, He is shaking
up the people, teaching throughout the whole of
Judea,  having begun from Galilee, insofar as here.

<sup>23:6</sup> But [after] Pilate heard Galilee, he asked if the
man is a Galilean. <sup>23:7</sup> And [after] having fully known
that he is from Herod’s authority, he sent him back to
Herod, who himself [was] also in Jerusalem in these
days.

<sup>23:8</sup> Now having seen Jesus, Herod rejoiced
exceedingly; for* he was wishing to see him from a
considerable [time], because he was hoping to see
some sign happening by him, and to hear many
things concerning him. <sup>23:9</sup> Now he was asking him
[questions] with* considerable words, but he answered
him nothing.
<sup>23:10</sup> Now the high-priests and the scribes stood,
intensely accusing him.
<sup>23:11</sup> Now Herod, together-with his soldiers, having
scorned and having mocked [him], and having dressed
him [in] bright apparel, sent him back to Pilate.
<sup>23:12</sup> Now both Pilate and Herod became friends
with one another in [that] same day; for* they were
formerly being in hostility toward themselves.

<sup>23:13</sup> Now Pilate called together the high-priests
and the rulers and the people, <sup>23:14</sup> [and] said to them,
You° brought this man to me, as one turning away the
people [to riot], and behold, I examined [him] in your°
sight, [and] did not find a crime in this man of which
you° accuse against him. <sup>23:15</sup> But even Herod [found
nothing]. For* he sent him back to you°, and behold,
nothing worthy of death has been done* by him. <sup>23:16</sup>
Therefore, [after] having disciplined him, I will be
releasing [him]. <sup>23:17</sup> But, he had to release to them one
[prisoner] every [Passover] feast [by] necessity.
<sup>23:18</sup> But they cried out altogether, saying, Take this
one and release Barabbas to us. <sup>23:19</sup> He was [one] who
had been put into prison because of a certain riot,
which happened in the city, and [for] murder.
<sup>23:20</sup> Therefore Pilate shouted [to them ]again,
wishing to release Jesus.
<sup>23:21</sup> But they were shouting out, saying, Crucify
[him]! Crucify him!
<sup>23:22</sup> Now he said to them the third-time, For* what
evil did*  this one do? I did not find a crime [worthy] of
death in him; therefore, [after] having disciplined him,
I will be releasing [him]. <sup>23:23</sup> But they were urgently
asking with loud voices [for] him to be crucified. And
their voices and [those] of the high-priests were
prevailing. <sup>23:24</sup> But Pilate decided their request [was]
to happen. <sup>23:25</sup> Now he released the one having been
cast into the prison because of riot and murder,
whom they were asking for, but he gave up Jesus to
their will.

{Mar 15:20-23 & Mat 27:31-34 & Luk 23:26-33 & Joh
19:17 Road to the Cross, Fri. morning.}
<sup>23:26</sup> And as they led him away, they grabbed
someone [named] Simon from Cyrene, coming from
the rural-area, [and] they placed the cross upon him to
carry it behind Jesus.

<sup>23:27</sup> Now a large multitude of the people were
following him, and women who also were grieving
and mourning [for] him. <sup>23:28</sup> But Jesus, having turned
to them, said,<span style="font-weight: bold">  Daughters of Jerusalem, do° not
weep over me, however, weep° over yourselves
and over your° children. <sup>23:29</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Because behold, the
days are coming in which they will say, The
fortunate ones [are]: barren and [the] wombs which
did not give-birth and the breasts that did not
nurse. <sup>23:30</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Then they will begin to say to the
mountains, Fall° upon us, and to the hills, Hide°
us. <sup>23:31</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Because if they are doing*  these things in
the green tree, what might happen in the dry?

<sup>23:32</sup> Now two others, also criminals, were being
led together-with him to be assassinated.

{Mar 15:24-32 & Mat 27:35-44 & Luk 23:33-43 & Joh
19:18-27 9:00 until Noon, Fri.}
<sup>23:33</sup> And when they came upon the place which is
called The Skull, they crucified him and the criminals
there, who [was] the one at [the] right and who [was] the
one at [the] left.
<sup>23:34</sup> Now Jesus said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Father, forgive them; for*
they do not know what they are doing* .
“Now [while] dividing his garments, they cast a lot.’
 <sup>23:35</sup> And the people stood viewing and the
rulers together-with them were also ridiculing [him],
saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this
one is the Christ, the chosen of God.
<sup>23:36</sup> Now the soldiers were also mocking him,
coming near and offering him vinegar, <sup>23:37</sup> and
saying, If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.
<sup>23:38</sup> Now an inscription was also over him, having
been written in [the] alphabets of Greek and Latin and
Hebrew, This is the King of the Jews.

<sup>23:39</sup> Now one of the criminals who was hung
[there], was blaspheming him, saying, If you are the
Christ save yourself and us!
<sup>23:40</sup> But, the other answered [and] was rebuking
him, saying, Do you not fear even God, because you
are in the same condemnation? <sup>23:41</sup> And we indeed
[suffer] righteously; for* we are receiving worthy
[payment] of what things we practiced, but this one
practiced nothing improper.
<sup>23:42</sup> And he said, Jesus, remember me Lord,
whenever you come in your kingdom.
<sup>23:43</sup> And Jesus said to him,<span style="font-weight: bold"> <span style="font-weight: bold">Assuredly I am
saying to you, You will be with me today in
Paradise.


<sup>23:44</sup> Now it was approximately the sixth hour and
it became darkness upon the whole earth until the
ninth hour .

{Mar 15:34-41 & Mat 27:46-56 & Luk 23:45-49 & Joh
19:28-30 around 5:00 PM.}
<sup>23:45</sup> And the sun was darkened and the curtain of
the temple was split-apart in the middle. <sup>23:46</sup> And
Jesus having shouted with a loud voice, said, <span style="font-weight: bold">Father,
I will consign my spirit into your hands. And
having said these things, he expired.
<sup>23:47</sup> Now having seen what happened, the
centurion glorified God, saying, This really was a
righteous man. <sup>23:48</sup> And all the crowds who came*
together upon this scene, viewing the things which
[had] happened, were returning, beating their chests.
<sup>23:49</sup> Now all his acquaintances and the women
who followed from Galilee together-with him, stood
from afar, seeing these things.

{Mar 15:42-47 & Mat 27:57-66 & Luk 23:50-56 & Joh
19:31-42 Before The Sabbath.}
<sup>23:50</sup> And behold, a man, Joseph by name, who is*
a counselor, a good and righteous man <sup>23:51</sup> (this one
was not in alliance with their plan and with [their]
practice), [a man] from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews,
who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of
God. <sup>23:52</sup> This one went to Pilate, [and] asked for the
body of Jesus. <sup>23:53</sup> And having taken it down, he
entwined it in a linen cloth and placed it in a hewed
out tomb, of which no one was yet laid.
<sup>23:54</sup> And it was the day [of] the Preparation [and] the
Sabbath was dawning. <sup>23:55</sup> Now having followed
after, [the] women, from Galilee, who were coming
together to him, saw the tomb and how his body was
placed.
<sup>23:56</sup> Now they returned and prepared spices and
perfumes. And [on] the Sabbath they indeed relaxed
according-to the commandment.

[Luke 24] <a id="Lk24"></a>

{Mar 16:1-8 & Mat 28:1-8 & Luk 24:1-8, 12 & Joh 20:1-10
Dawn and very early Sun.}
<sup>24:1</sup> Now on the first [day] of the week, from [the]
deep [foggy] daybreak, they and some [others] together-with them came upon the tomb, bringing the spices
which they [had] prepared. <sup>24:2</sup> Now they found the
stone has been rolled away from the tomb. <sup>24:3</sup> And
having entered [in], they did not find the body of the
Lord Jesus. <sup>24:4</sup> And it happened, while* they were
perplexed concerning this, and behold, two men
stood by them in flashing apparels. <sup>24:5</sup> Now [after]
they themselves became fearful and bowing the[ir]
face [down] toward the earth, [then] they said to them,
Why are you° seeking the living with the dead? <sup>24:6</sup>
He is not here, but was raised. Remember° how he
spoke to you°, being still in Galilee, <sup>24:7</sup> saying that it
is essential [for] the Son of Man to be given up into the
hands of sinful men and to be crucified and to rise*
up [on] the third day? <sup>24:8</sup> And they were reminded of
his declarations.


<sup>24:9</sup> And having returned from the tomb, they
reported all these things to the eleven and to all the
rest. <sup>24:10</sup> Now they were, Mary the Magdalene and
Joanna and Mary [the] [mother] of James and the rest [of
the women] together-with them, [those ]who were
saying these things to the apostles. <sup>24:11</sup> And their
declarations appeared like nonsense in their sight,
and they were disbelieving them. <sup>24:12</sup> But Peter,
having stood up, ran to the tomb, and peered [inside]
and he sees the linen-strips laying alone. And he
went away with himself , marveling at what
has happened.

{Mar 16:12-13 & Luk 24:13-35 & 1Co 15:5 Sun.
Afternoon.}
<sup>24:13</sup> And behold, two out-of them were traveling
in [that] same day to a village which [has the] name
Emmaus, being sixty furlongs distant from
Jerusalem. <sup>24:14</sup> And they were conversing with one
another concerning all these things which have
befallen [them]. <sup>24:15</sup> And it happened, while* they were
conversing and debating together, [that] Jesus himself,
having drawn near, was traveling together-with them.
<sup>24:16</sup> But their eyes were being held-fast [so as] not to
recognize him. <sup>24:17</sup> But he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">What words
[are] these which you° are exchanging [back and
forth] with one another, [while]<span style="font-weight: bold"> walking? and you°
are [with] a gloomy face, [why]?
<sup>24:18</sup> But one who [has the] name Cleopas answered
[and] said to him, Are you sojourning alone in
Jerusalem and did not know [of] the things which
happened in her in these days?
<sup>24:19</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">What things?
But they said to him, The things concerning Jesus
of the Nazarenes, who became a prophet, a mighty
man in work and word in front of God and all the
people; <sup>24:20</sup> and how the high-priests and our rulers
gave him up to [the] condemnation of death and
crucified him. <sup>24:21</sup> Now we were hoping that he is the
one being about to redeem Israel. But yet today,
together-with all these things, is bringing* [us] this
third day from which these things happened. <sup>24:22</sup> But
some women from [among] us also astonished us,
having happened [to be] at the tomb at daybreak, <sup>24:23</sup>
and having not found his body, they came, saying
also, to have seen a vision of messengers, who are
saying [about] him to be living. <sup>24:24</sup> And some of the
ones [who were] together-with us, went in the tomb
and also found [it] so, just-as the women said, but they
did not see him.
<sup>24:25</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">O [you]°<span style="font-weight: bold"> foolish [ones] and
slow in heart to believe upon all which the
<span style="font-weight: bold">prophets spoke! <sup>24:26</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Was it not essential [for] the
Christ to suffer these things and to enter into his
glory? <sup>24:27</sup> And having begun from Moses and from
all the prophets, he was clarifying for them in all the
Scriptures the things concerning himself. <sup>24:28</sup> And
they drew near to the village, where they were
traveling and he was making-like [that he was ]to
travel farther.
<sup>24:29</sup> And they constrained him, saying, Abide with
us, because it is toward dusk and the day has been
far-spent. And he entered in to abide together-with
them. <sup>24:30</sup> And it happened, while* he was reclining
with them [at the table], [and] having taken the bread,
he gave-thanks and broke [it] [and] he was giving [it] to
them.
<sup>24:31</sup> Now their eyes were opened and they
recognized him, and he became unapparent from
them . <sup>24:32</sup> And they said to one

he was speaking to us on the road, and as he was
opening the Scriptures to us?
<sup>24:33</sup> And having stood up in[ that] same hour, they
returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven, having
been accumulated together, and the ones together-with them, <sup>24:34</sup> saying, The Lord was really raised
and was seen by Simon. <sup>24:35</sup> And they were
describing the things [which happened] on the road
and how he was known by them in the breaking of
the bread.


<sup>24:36</sup> Now [while] they themselves [are] speaking
these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them
and says to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Peace [is] to you°. <sup>24:37</sup> But they
became terrified and fearful and were thinking to be
viewing a spirit. <sup>24:38</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Why are

in your° hearts? <sup>24:39</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold">Behold<span style="font-weight: bold">° my hands and my

a spirit does not have flesh and bones, like you°

showed them the hands and the feet. <sup>24:41</sup> But [they]
themselves still disbelieving from the joy, and
marveling ; he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Do
you° have anything edible here? <sup>24:42</sup> Now they gave
part of a broiled fish to him and [part] from the
honeycomb. <sup>24:43</sup> And having taken [it], he ate [it] in their
sight.


<sup>24:44</sup> Now he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">These [are] the words
which I spoke to you°, being still together-with
you°, that it is essential [for] all things to be
fulfilled, which have been written in the Law of
Moses and the prophets and the Psalms,
concerning me. <sup>24:45</sup> Then he opened their mind to
understand the Scriptures.

<sup>24:46</sup> And he said to them, <span style="font-weight: bold">Thus it has been

suffer and to rise* up from the dead in the third

of sins[ is] to be preached in his name to all the

of my Father upon you°, but you° stick-around<span style="font-weight: bold">° in
the city of Jerusalem, until you° should be clothed
with power from on high.

{Mar 16:19-20 & Luk 24:50-53 & Acts 1:9-12 Olivet,
between Jerusalem and Bethany.}
<sup>24:50</sup> Now he led them outside until [they were] in
Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and spoke well of
 them. <sup>24:51</sup> And it happened,
while* he blessed them, he stood away from them and
was being carried up into heaven. <sup>24:52</sup> And they,
having worshiped him, returned into Jerusalem with
great joy <sup>24:53</sup> and they were always in the temple,
praising and thanking God.
Amen.

<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 0.005in">{{ Introduction to John 67-95 AD
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The Good-news account by John, which was most likely
written after the other three, fills in some gaps that were not
covered by Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Eight percent of
Matthew, Mark, and Luke are in John, and ninety-two percent
is unique to John through the Holy Spirit. No specific writer is
stated but the similarities in writing style, thought patterns,
vocabulary and the “very’ Koine Greek language of the Good-news of John, 1-3 John, and Revelation (denoted as “John’) is
unmistakable. This “John’ was always assumed to be apostle
John, the son of Zebedee.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">John writes to a general audience. John talks about the
unbelieving Jews and equates them to the world. He also talks
about the Greek speaking Jews (Hellenistic) in this book and
shows many witnesses confirming that Jesus is the Christ
prophesied of in the Old Testament. John states his purpose in
20:30, 31 where signs were recorded for a specific purpose to
bring about faith in Jesus. John recognizes that unless one has
this faith (belief), he will not have eternal life. John also
explains what belief in Jesus really means in John 3:36 and that
belief is obedience according-to John through inspiration. John
begins his biography of Jesus by starting at the very creation of
the world, showing Jesus as “The Word was God’ and “became
flesh and resided among us’ (John 1:1-3, 14). If it help
understand the preeminence of Jesus as God in chapter one, the
words: become, became, can be translated as &#8220;come into being&#8221;.
From there, the focus is on showing the life, teachings, and
miracles of Jesus in such a way that the reader might “believe
that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, [the
reader ]may have life in His name’ (John 20:30-31). So as you
read this great book from God, focus on how John builds the
witnesses of Jesus, the signs, and wonders of God’s Son and
how God brings about faith and belief in the reader with
confidence that Jesus is God’s Son. Among other things, it is in
this Good-news account that we learn that Jesus rejected the
idea of setting up an earthly kingdom (John 6:15, 18:36). A later
writing of John, Revelation tells us he made for us, Christians,
a kingdom, and we are the priests of God, Revelation 1:6.}}

through him, and without him not even one [thing]
became which has become [into being]. <sup>1:4</sup> Life was in

light is appearing in the darkness, and the darkness
did not overtake  it.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>1:6</sup> It happened [that] a man [came], having been sent
from God, [and] his name [was] John. <sup>1:7</sup> This one came
*for a testimony, in-order-that he might testify
concerning the light, in-order-that all should believe

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>1:9</sup> He was the true* light coming into the world,
[the light] which illuminates every man. <sup>1:10</sup> He was in

world did not know him.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>1:11</sup> He came to [his] own and [his] own did not
receive him. <sup>1:12</sup> But as many as received him, he
gave to them [the] authority to become children of
God, to the ones who believe in his name, <sup>1:13</sup> who
were born, not from bloods, nor from the will of the
flesh, nor from the will of man, but from God.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>1:14</sup> And the Word became flesh and resided
among us (and we saw his glory, glory like [that] of
the only begotten from the Father), full of favor and
truth. <sup>1:15</sup> John testifies concerning him and cried,
saying, This one was he of whom I spoke, He who is
coming after me, has become before me, because he
was first, [then] me. <sup>1:16</sup> And we all received out-of his
fullness and favor in exchange-for favor. <sup>1:17</sup> Because
the law was given through Moses; the favor and the
truth became through Jesus Christ. <sup>1:18</sup> No one has
seen God at anytime; the only begotten Son, who is
in the bosom of the Father, that one [has] described
[him].

together-with his disciples into the small-boat, but
his disciples went away alone <sup>6:23</sup> (but other small-boats came from Tiberias near the place where they
ate the bread [after] the Lord gave-thanks). <sup>6:24</sup>
Therefore, when the crowd saw that Jesus is not

into the ships and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.

19:1-7; Saul/Apostle Paul: 9:17-18, -16, 26:12-18 are in chart below and these are great examples of Jesus' “great commission' in action
(harmonized on page 7).
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">Others are possibly noted by Luke's term “believed' but not all details were given since the Greek word for “believed' carries with
it “obedience' and continued action: Acts 4:1-4; 11:21 (note “conversion' is the Greek noun form of “turned'), 13:12; 13:48; 14:1 & 2
(note the contrast of believed vs. disobedient) then later 14:21-23, (note they were called disciples, Mat 28:19, “in the faith', elders,
every congregation); 17:12-14; 17:32-34; 19:15-20. Now since Crispus listed below was immersed as recorded in 1Co 1:14, this lets
us know that even when all the elements of conversion aren't specifically listed, it is still safe to assume they all occurred.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The Bible is not written in exhaustive encyclopedia form. God only told us what we need to know and practice if we love him, John
14:15. The biggest lies ever told to a Christian is “The Bible doesn't say not to...' or that “It is okay to substitute' and the O.T. is binding
in any way on us Christians.

<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The book of Acts, or the [Book of Conversions], is a history of
the establishment of various congregations and the expansion of
Christianity. It is actually a continuation of the gospel of Luke,
written by the same author to the same audience. A good outline
for the whole book is given by Jesus in 1:8: “you will be
witnesses to me, both in Jerusalem (chapters 1-6) and in all
Judea and Samaria (chapter 8), and to the outermost parts of the
earth (9-28).’
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">These Roman emperors reigned during this period were as
follows: Tiberius (14-37 A.D.), Caligula (37-41), Claudius (41-54), and Nero (54-68). 
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">This book covers about 30 years.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">In this book are the only examples in the entire New
Testament of how people are saved from their sins following the
death of Christ Jesus; great examples of the “Great Commission’
in action. In fact, the question, “what will we do?’ is asked and
answered multiple times in this book. The Jews (Acts 2), the
Samaritans (Acts 8), the Gentiles (Acts 10), the Philippian jailer
(Acts 16), and Saul (Acts 9,22, 26) were taught about Christ
Jesus, and salvation was offered to them all in the same way.
Saul, (later, apostle Paul), even though called from heaven, was
even told what was essential to do, (Acts 22:16).
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The last half of the book focuses mainly on the travels of the
apostle Paul, who went throughout the Roman Empire teaching
people what to do to be saved. During his travels, many of the
New Testament letters were written to various congregations.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">Look closely in this book to see what commands are from
God, and put them to the test of men in regards to salvation and
how Jesus built his congregation of believers.}}

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>4:1</sup> Now [while] speaking to the people, the priests
and the magistrate of the temple and the Sadducees
stood by them, <sup>4:2</sup> being pained, because they teach
the people and proclaim [the] resurrection of the dead
in Jesus. <sup>4:3</sup> And they put hands upon them and they
themselves placed [them] in jail to the next-day; for* it
was already dusk. <sup>4:4</sup> But many of the ones who heard
the word believed, and [the] number of the men
happened [to be ]approximately five thousand.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>4:5</sup> Now it happened upon the next-day [for] their
rulers and the elders and scribes to be gathered
together in Jerusalem; <sup>4:6</sup> and Annas the high-priest
[was there] and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and
as many as were from [the] high-priestly race. <sup>4:7</sup> And
having stood them in [the] middle, they were inquiring,
In what power or in what name, have you° done* this?
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>4:8</sup> Then Peter, having been filled with [the] Holy
Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders
of Israel, <sup>4:9</sup> if we are examined today upon [the basis
of] a good* work [done to] a sick man [and] by what
[means] this one has been cured. <sup>4:10</sup> Let it be known to
you<sup>&#176; </sup>all [here] and to all the people of Israel, that in the
name of Jesus Christ of the Nazarenes, whom you°
crucified, whom God raised [up] from [the] dead; in
him, this one who is standing in your° sight [is]
healthy. <sup>4:11</sup> This one is, “The stone which was
scorned by you°, the builders, the one which became
to [you] the head of the corner.’ <sup>4:12</sup> And
salvation is not in any other; for* neither is there a
different name [under the heavens], which has been
given among men, in which it is essential [for] us to be
saved.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>4:13</sup> Now viewing the boldness of Peter and John,
they were marveling, having comprehended that they
are illiterate and unskilled men. And they recognized
them, that they had been together-with Jesus. <sup>4:14</sup> But
seeing the man who had been healed, standing
together-with them, they had nothing to speak against
[it]. <sup>4:15</sup> But having commanded them to go outside the
council, they were pondering [these things] with one
another, <sup>4:16</sup> saying, What will we do* to these men?
For* that indeed a known sign has happened through
them [and] apparent to all the ones dwelling [in]
Jerusalem, and we are not able to deny [it]. <sup>4:17</sup> But in-order-that it should not circulate more-than [this] into
the people, we will threaten them with [more]
threatening, to no longer speak to any men in this
name. <sup>4:18</sup> And having called them [back], they
commanded them not to speak nor teach entirely
upon the name of Jesus.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>4:19</sup> But Peter and John answered and said to them,
Judge° [for yourselves] if it is righteous in God’s sight
to listen [to words] from you° rather than from God. <sup>4:20</sup>
For* we are unable to not speak what we saw and
heard. <sup>4:21</sup> But having additionally threatened [them],
they released them, finding nothing [as to] how they
will punish them, because of the people, because all
were glorifying God over what has happened. <sup>4:22</sup> For*
the man was more-than forty years [old], upon whom
this sign of healing had happened.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>4:23</sup> Now having been released, they came to [their
]own [brethren] and reported how-much the high-priests and the elders had said to them. <sup>4:24</sup> Now they,
having heard [it], lifted [up their ]voice to God united
and said, Master, you [are] the God who made* the
heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in
them; <sup>4:25</sup> who through the mouth of your young-servant David, said, “Why did the Gentiles rage and
the peoples meditate [on] empty things? <sup>4:26</sup> The kings
of the earth stood [up] and the rulers were gathered in
the same [place], against the Lord and against his
Christ.’  <sup>4:27</sup> For* against truth, against your
holy young-servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both
Herod and Pontius Pilate, together-with the Gentiles
and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together <sup>4:28</sup>
to do* as many things as your hand and your council
determined beforehand to happen. <sup>4:29</sup> And hereafter,
Lord, look upon their threats and give to your
bondservants to speak your word with all boldness,
<sup>4:30</sup> [for] you to stretch out in your hand *for healing,
and signs and wonders to happen through the name
of your holy young-servant Jesus. <sup>4:31</sup> And having
besought [the Lord], the place was shaken in which
they were gathered together, and they were all filled
with [the] Holy Spirit and they were speaking the word
of God with boldness.

were of one heart and soul and not one [of them] said
[that] anything of [his] own possessions is for
themselves, but all things were common to them. <sup>4:33</sup>
And the apostles were giving the[ir] testimony of the
resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power and
great favor was upon them all. <sup>4:34</sup> For* neither
anyone among them was* needy. For* as many as
were* owners of parcels of ground or houses, [were

pilfered [part] for themselves from the price, his wife
also having been conscious [of it], and brought a
certain part, placed it beside the apostles’ feet. <sup>5:3</sup> But
Peter said, Ananias, why [has] the Adversary filled
your heart to lie [to] the Holy Spirit and [for] you to
pilfer [part]  for yourself from the price of the parcel of
ground? <sup>5:4</sup> [While it is] remaining [unsold], was it not
remaining yours? And having been sold*, was* it [not
still] in your authority? Why did you purpose this
matter in your heart? You did not lie to men, but to
God. <sup>5:5</sup> But Ananias, hearing these words, fell [down]
and expired, and great fear came* upon all the ones
hearing these things. <sup>5:6</sup> Now [after] the younger-men
stood up, they enshrouded him and carried [him] out
and buried [him].
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>5:7</sup> Now it happened [after] an interval of
approximately three hours, his wife also entered, not

her, Tell me if you° were given so-much [for] the
parcel of ground?
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">And she said, Yes, [for] so-much.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>5:9</sup> But Peter said to her, Why [is it] that it was
agreed together by you° to test the Spirit of the Lord?
Behold, the feet of the ones who buried your husband
[are] at the door and they will be carrying you out. <sup>5:10</sup>
Now she fell [down] instantly beside his feet and
expired and the young-men entered and found her
dead [and] they carried [her] out and buried [her] with her

signs and wonders were happening among the
people, and they were all united at Solomon’s porch.
<sup>5:13</sup> But no one of the rest was daring to be joined to
them, but the people were applauding them; <sup>5:14</sup> and
more believers, multitudes of both men and women,
were adding themselves to the Lord. <sup>5:15</sup> So-then [they
started] to carry out the sick in the streets, to lay [them]
upon cots and pallets, in-order-that, [while] Peter
comes [by], if-only the shadow [of him ]might
overshadow anyone of them. <sup>5:16</sup> Now the multitude
was also coming together from the cities in and
around Jerusalem, carrying sick [people], and [those]
being troubled by unclean spirits; [and] who were all
being healed.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>5:17</sup> But the high-priest stood up and all [those who
were] together-with him (the one[ which ]is a sect of the
Sadducees) and they were filled [up] from jealousy, <sup>5:18</sup>
and they put their hands upon the apostles and placed
them in [the] public jail. <sup>5:19</sup> But a messenger of the
Lord through [the] night, opened the doors of the
prison, and having led them out, said, <sup>5:20</sup> Travel°, and
[when] you° have stood [up] in the temple, speak° to the
people all the words of this life. <sup>5:21</sup> Now having
heard [this], they entered the temple under the [light of]
daybreak and were teaching.

together-with him and called the Sanhedrin together
and everyone of the Elderly-Council of the sons of
Israel and sent to the prison to have them led [out]. <sup>5:22</sup>
But the attendants who came* did not find them in
the prison. Now having turned back, they reported,
<sup>5:23</sup> saying, We indeed found the prison, having been
locked with* all [the] security [intact], and the guards
standing before the doors. But having opened [it], we
found no one inside. <sup>5:24</sup> Now as both the magistrate
of the temple and the priest and the high-priests
heard these words, they were perplexed concerning
them [as to] why this would have happened.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>5:25</sup> But someone came*, and reported to them,
Behold, the men, whom you° placed in the prison
yourselves, are in the temple standing and teaching
the people. <sup>5:26</sup> Then the magistrate together-with the
attendants went away [and] led them, [but] with no
violence; for* they were fearing the people (that* they
might not be stoned). <sup>5:27</sup> Now having led them, they
stood [them] in [front of] the council. And the high-priest asked them, <sup>5:28</sup> saying, Did we command you°
with a [strict] command to not teach in this name? And
behold, you° have filled Jerusalem from your°
teaching, and are planning to bring* this man’s blood
upon us.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>5:29</sup> But Peter and the apostles answered [and] said,
It is essential [for us] to obey God rather than men. <sup>5:30</sup>
The God of our fathers raised [up] Jesus, whom you°
yourselves exterminated, having hung [him] upon a
tree. <sup>5:31</sup> This[ Jesus is] [the] Author and Savior who God
exalted to his right [hand], to give repentance to Israel
and forgiveness of sins. <sup>5:32</sup> And we are witnesses of
these words, and [so is] the Holy Spirit, whom God
gave to the ones who obey him.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>5:33</sup> But hearing [this], they were being infuriated
and were planning to assassinate them. <sup>5:34</sup> But a
certain one in the council stood up [there], a Pharisee,
Gamaliel by name, a teacher of the law, honored by
all the people, and he commanded [them] to make* the
apostles [wait] outside [for] a certain bit [of time]. <sup>5:35</sup> And
he said to them, Men, Israelites! Take-heed° to
yourselves what you° are about to do* against these
men. <sup>5:36</sup> For* before these days rose* up Theudas,
saying [that he] himself to be someone, who was
assassinated; to whom a number of men were called,
approximately four hundred; and all, as many as were
obeying him were disbanded and came* to nothing.
<sup>5:37</sup> After this one rose* up Judas, a Galilean, in the
days of the census and a considerable [number of]
people withdrew after him. He also perished, and all,
as many as were obeying him, were scattered. <sup>5:38</sup>
And hereafter I say to you°, Withdraw° from these
men and permit° them [to continue,] because if the plan
or this work is from men, it will be torn-down; <sup>5:39</sup>
but if it is from God, you° are not able to tear-down
it; lest you° might be found even [to be ]quarreling
against God.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>5:40</sup> Now they were persuaded by him, and having
called the apostles [to them], they whipped [them], and
commanded [them ]not to speak in the name of Jesus
and released them. <sup>5:41</sup> Therefore indeed, they were
traveling away from the face of the council, rejoicing
that they were deemed worthy to be dishonored on
behalf of the name of Jesus. <sup>5:42</sup> And they were not
ceasing, teaching and proclaiming the good-news:
Jesus [is] the Christ, every day both in the temple and
in every house.

Then [after] he went forth out-of the land of the
Chaldeans, he dwelt in Haran and after his father
died, [God] exiled him from there into this land in
which you° are now dwelling.  <sup>7:5</sup> And
he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a step of

world and all things in it, this one being* Lord of
heaven and earth, is not dwelling in temples made*
with hands; <sup>17:25</sup> nor is he assisted by men’s hands, [as

they are] to seek the Lord, if then, they might yet
grope after him and might find [him], for-sure, he is*
 not far from each one of us. <sup>17:28</sup> For* we
live and are moved and are in him; as some poets
also have said according-to you°, For* we are also his
offspring. {Possible reference to a Stoic poet, Aratus of Soli

[that] the divine* is similar to gold or silver or stone, [or]
a carved thing from a craft and the contemplation of
man. <sup>17:30</sup> Therefore indeed, God overlooked the
times of ignorance. Hereafter, he is commanding all
men everywhere to repent; <sup>17:31</sup> because he [has]
established a future day in which to judge the
inhabited-earth in righteousness in the man whom he
[has] determined [beforehand]; having provided [the]

the Jews [and] being about to be assassinated by them,
I stood [up] together-with the army and liberated him,
having learned that he is a Roman. <sup>23:28</sup> But planning
to know the accusation (because of which they were
accusing him), I led him into their council; <sup>23:29</sup> whom
I found being accused concerning debates of their
law, having nothing [in way of] an accusation worthy
of death or of bonds. <sup>23:30</sup> But [after] it was divulged to
me of a future pact by the Jews *for the man, I
promptly sent [him] to you, having also commanded
the accusers to speak the things to him in front of

Paul [and] led [him] through the night to Antipatris. <sup>23:32</sup>
But on the next-day, having permitted the horsemen
to travel together-with him, they returned to the
encampment, <sup>23:33</sup> who, having entered into Caesarea,
and having given over the letter to the governor, also
presented Paul to him. <sup>23:34</sup> Now the governor read
[the letter] and having asked: What province is he
from? And having inquired: [he is] from Cilicia. <sup>23:35</sup>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>24:10</sup> Now [after] the governor signaled to him to

myself. <sup>24:11</sup> You [surely] are able to know that there

temple, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city, <sup>24:13</sup> nor
are they able to present [things] concerning me[, ]of
which they are now accusing me. <sup>24:14</sup> But I confess
this thing to you, that thus I am giving-divine service
to the God of our forefathers according-to The Way,
which they call* a sect, believing all things [which are]
according-to the law and which have been written in
the prophets. <sup>24:15</sup> I have hope toward God, which
these themselves also [have]; they are waiting for[ that
time] there will be a future resurrection of [the] dead,
both of [the] righteous and unrighteous. <sup>24:16</sup> But I
apply myself in this, having a guilt-free conscience
always toward God and men. <sup>24:17</sup> Now I came*
through many years, (will do*  charities and offerings
to my nation); <sup>24:18</sup> in which they found me, having
been purified in the temple, not with a crowd, nor
with an uproar [with] some Jews from Asia. <sup>24:19</sup> Whom
it is essential [for them] to be here and to accuse [me] in

<sup>24:20</sup> Or let° these [men] themselves say what
wrongdoing they found in me [when] I stood in front
of the council, <sup>24:21</sup> or concerning this one voice of

more accurately concerning The Way, Felix himself
postponed [judging] them, [and] said, Whenever Lysias
the commander comes-down, I will be investigating
the things against you°. <sup>24:23</sup> And he himself
commanded the centurion to guard Paul and [for him]
to have relief and to forbid no one of his own to
attend or to come near to him.

Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
<sup>24:25</sup> But [while] he  is reasoning concerning
righteousness and self-control and the future

answered, Travel [on], hereafter having [time] and
having taken the opportunity, I myself will call you.
<sup>24:26</sup> (And [while] hoping at the same-time that monies
will be given to him by Paul, *that he might loose

sending for him frequently. <sup>24:27</sup> But [after] two years
were fulfilled, Felix received a successor, Porcius
Festus, and wishing to lay up favors for himself with
the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.

and they were pleading with him, <sup>25:3</sup> asking for a

[come to] Jerusalem; making* a plot to assassinate him
in [his] journey.

days, he went-down to Caesarea. On the next-day
having sat upon the judicial-seat, he commanded
Paul to be led [before him]. <sup>25:7</sup> Now [after] he came*, the
Jews who had come-down from Jerusalem stood
around him, bringing many and cruel accusations
against Paul, which they were not strong-enough to
show.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>25:8</sup> [Then Paul,] making his defense, [said], Neither
at the law of the Jews nor at the temple nor at Caesar,
did I sin in anything.

Are you willing, [after] having gone-up to Jerusalem,
to be judged there concerning these things in front of
me?
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>25:10</sup> But Paul said, I am standing in front of
Caesar’s judicial-seat, where it is essential [for] me to
be judged. I was not wronging the Jews, as you also
fully well know. <sup>25:11</sup> For* if I indeed am wronging
[anyone], and have practiced anything worthy of death,
I do not renounce to die, but if there is nothing of
what these are accusing me; no one is able to grant
me to them. I myself am appealing to Caesar. <sup>25:12</sup>
Then Festus, having spoken together with the
council, answered, You yourself have appealed [to be]
in front of Caesar, [then] you will be traveling over [to]
Caesar.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>25:13</sup> Now [after] some days elapsed, Agrippa the

Festus. <sup>25:14</sup> Now as he was staying there many days,
Festus submitted to the King, the things according-to
Paul[’s case], saying, There is a certain man, a
prisoner, who has been left [behind] by Felix; <sup>25:15</sup>
concerning whom, having happened of me {i.e. when
I got} into Jerusalem, the high-priests and the elders
of the Jews disclosed [things to me], asking for a
sentence against him. <sup>25:16</sup> To whom I answered, It is
not a custom with Romans to grant [as a favor] any
man to destruction, preferably before he who is
accused, might have the accusers according-to face
, and might receive a chance for
defense concerning the accusation.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>25:17</sup> Therefore, [after] they themselves came
together here, I made* no postponement [of their
meeting] to the next [day], having sat upon the judicial-seat, I commanded the man to be led [there]. <sup>25:18</sup>
Concerning whom, [after] the accusers stood up, they
were bringing no accusation of things [as] I was
perceiving; <sup>25:19</sup> but they were having some debates
with him concerning [his ]own religion and concerning
someone [named] Jesus, who had died, whom Paul
was claiming [him] to be living. <sup>25:20</sup> But being
perplexed [as to ]the debate concerning this, I was
saying [to him], if he might be willing to travel to
Jerusalem and to be judged there concerning these
things. <sup>25:21</sup> But [after] Paul himself appealed to be kept
*for the decision of the Emperor, I commanded him
to be kept until I should send him to Caesar. <sup>25:22</sup> But
Agrippa said to Festus, I was also planning to hear
from the man myself.

Bernice came with much pomp, and entered into the
auditorium together-with both, the commanders and
men according-to prominence, who are from the city,
and [after] Festus commanded, Paul was led  [before
him]. <sup>25:24</sup> And Festus says, King Agrippa, and all men
who are here together-with us, you° are viewing this
one, concerning whom all the multitude of the Jews
petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying [it
is ]to be essential [for] him to live no longer. <sup>25:25</sup> But I
comprehended for myself [that] he has done* nothing
worthy of death, and I decided to send him, [since] this
one himself [had] also appealed to the Emperor; <sup>25:26</sup>
concerning whom, I do not have any certainty [as
what] to write to [my] lord. Hence, I led him in front of
you° and especially in front of you, King Agrippa,
*that, [after] [his] examination [has] happened, I might
have something to write. <sup>25:27</sup> For* it seems

beforehand, from the start), that I lived [as] a Pharisee
according-to the strictest sect of our religion. <sup>26:6</sup> And

be essential [for me] to practice many things adverse to

Hence, be° cheerful, men; for* I believe God, that it
will be so according-to what [is] in the manner [that] it
has been spoken to me. <sup>27:26</sup> But it is essential [for] us
to fall onto a certain island.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>27:27</sup> Now as it became the fourteenth night, our
being carried [to and fro] in the Adriatic [Sea], in the
middle of the night, the sailors were perceiving some
region to be preceding them. <sup>27:28</sup> And having
sounded, they found twenty fathoms, and [after] a [little]
bit [of] an interval [of time], having sounded again, they
found fifteen fathoms. <sup>27:29</sup> And fearing lest we might
fall into rough places, they tossed [the] four anchors
from the stern [and] was praying[ for it] to become day.
<sup>27:30</sup> But the sailors [were] seeking to flee out-of the
ship and having lowered the boat into the sea in
pretext, as [though] being about to heave out anchors
from the prow, <sup>27:31</sup> Paul said to the centurion and to
the soldiers, If these [sailors] do not remain in the
ship, you° are not able to be saved. <sup>27:32</sup> Then the
soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and permitted
her to fall. <sup>27:33</sup> Now till which [time] it was about to
become day, Paul was encouraging [them] all to take
[some] nourishment, saying, Today [is] the fourteenth
day [that you° are] expecting [to arrive]; you° are
continuing famished, having taken nothing [to eat] for
yourselves. <sup>27:34</sup> Hence I am encouraging you° to take
[some] nourishment; for* this is* for your° salvation;
for* not a hair will be falling from the head of [any]
one of you°. <sup>27:35</sup> Now having said these things and
having taken bread, he gave-thanks to God in the
sight of all, and he broke [it] and began to eat. <sup>27:36</sup>
Now [when] all became cheerful, they themselves also
took nourishment. <sup>27:37</sup> Now we were in the ship, all
two hundred and seventy-six souls. <sup>27:38</sup> Now having
been satisfied from the nourishment, they lightened
the ship, casting the grain forth into the sea.

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>27:39</sup> Now when it became day, they were not
recognizing the land. But they were considering a
certain bay, having a beach into which they planned
if possible to drive the ship. <sup>27:40</sup> And having taken off
the [couplings to the] anchors, they were permitting
[them to fall ]in the sea, having laxed the rudders’
couplings at the same-time. And having lifted up the
foresail to the blowing [wind], they were heading
toward the beach. <sup>27:41</sup> But having fallen into a place
at the intersection of two seas, they beached the
cargo-ship, and indeed the prow stuck and remained
unshakable, but the stern was being dissolved by the
violence of the waves.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>27:42</sup> Now the soldiers’ plan happened [to be] that*
they should kill the prisoners, lest some, having
swam out, should flee. <sup>27:43</sup> But the centurion,
planning to save Paul, forbade them from the[ir] will,
and commanded the ones being  able to swim, [after]
they first tossed [themselves] over to go-out over [to] the
land; <sup>27:44</sup> and the rest, who indeed [were] upon planks
and who [were] upon any [other] things from the ship.
And so it happened, all [were] to be saved upon the
land.

that the island is called Malta. <sup>28:2</sup> Now the barbarians
were providing for us [and] we obtained not [just]
kindliness; for* they lit a fire, and took us all [in],
because of the standing rainfall and because of the
cold. <sup>28:3</sup> But [after] Paul twisted together a bunch of
brush and laid [it] upon the fire, a viper attached to his
hand, [after] it came forth through [the brush] from the
warmth. <sup>28:4</sup> Now as the barbarians saw the snake
hanging from his hand, they were saying to one
another, This man is certainly a murderer, whom,
having been saved out-of the sea, justice did not
permit [him] to live. <sup>28:5</sup> Therefore indeed, he shook-off
the snake into the fire [and] suffered no evil. <sup>28:6</sup> But
they were expecting him to be about to swell up or to
suddenly fall down dead. But expecting [it] over much
[time] and viewing nothing improper happening to
him, having a turnabout, they were saying him to be
a god.

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>28:7</sup> Now in the [regions] around that place, were*
farms possessed by the foremost one of the island,
Publius by name, who, having accepted us, lodged [us]
courteously three days. <sup>28:8</sup> Now it happened, [that ]the
father of Publius lay [sick], being troubled with fevers
and dysentery; to whom Paul having entered and
prayed [and] laid his hands upon him, healed him. <sup>28:9</sup>
Therefore, [after] this happened, the rest who have [any]
sicknesses in the island were also coming near and
were being healed, <sup>28:10</sup> who also honored us with
many honors, and [while] setting-sail, they placed upon
[the ship] the things for [our] need.

remained [there] three days. <sup>28:13</sup> From where, we went
around [and] arrived at Rhegium and after one day a
south [wind] came* upon [us and on ]the second [day] we
came to Puteoli; <sup>28:14</sup> where we found brethren [and]
were encouraged to remain upon  them
seven days and so we came to Rome. <sup>28:15</sup> And the
brethren from there, [after] they heard things
concerning us, came to [the] encounter with us up-to
the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns; whom
having seen, Paul gave-thanks to God [and] took
courage.

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>28:17</sup> Now after three days, Paul happened to call
[together] the ones who are the foremost of the Jews
and [after] they came together, he said to them, Men,
brethren, I practiced  nothing adverse to the [Jewish]
people or the customs of our forefathers. I, a prisoner
from Jerusalem, was given up into the hands of the
Romans. <sup>28:18</sup> [The Romans] who, having examined [me],
were planning to release me, because no crime
[worthy] of death [was found] to exist in me. <sup>28:19</sup> But the
Jews [were] speaking against [it], [then] I was urged to
appeal [to] Caesar; not like I hold anything [of which] to
accuse my nation. <sup>28:20</sup> Therefore, because of this
accusation, I pleaded to see and to speak to you°; for*
I am encompassed [with] this chain because of the
hope of Israel[.]
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>28:21</sup> But they said to him, We neither accepted
writings from Judea concerning you, nor did anyone
of the brethren come* [here] and report or speak
anything evil concerning you. <sup>28:22</sup> But we deem [it]
worthy to hear from you what things you are mindful
of; for* indeed, concerning this sect, it is known to us
that it is spoken against everywhere.

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>28:23</sup> Now having appointed him a day, they were
coming to him, more into the lodging; to whom he
was expounding [the word,] thoroughly testifying of
the kingdom of God also persuading them [with] the
things concerning Jesus, both from the Law of Moses
and from the prophets, from morning until dusk. <sup>28:24</sup>
And some were obeying and [some] were disbelieving
the things being  spoken. <sup>28:25</sup> But being [in]
disagreement with one another, they were dismissing
[themselves] [after] Paul said [just] one declaration, The
Holy Spirit spoke well through Isaiah the prophet to
our fathers, <sup>28:26</sup> saying, “Travel to this people and
say, In hearing you° will hear and [yet] should never
understand, and [in] seeing you° will see and [yet] should
never know; <sup>28:27</sup> for* the heart of this people became-callous and they [have] selectively heard with the[ir]
ears and they closed their eyes. Lest, they should see
with the[ir] eyes and should hear with the[ir] ears and
should understand with the[ir] heart and should return
and I will be healing them.’ 
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>28:28</sup> Therefore let it be known to you°, that the
salvation from God was sent to the Gentiles and they
will be  hearing [it]. <sup>28:29</sup> And [after] he said these things
of him, the Jews went away, having much debate
among themselves.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>28:30</sup> Now Paul remained two whole years in [his]

<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">After you know about who Jesus was in the first four books
and have followed an example of how to become a Christian in
Acts, then comes the remainder of the New Testament. A
collection of letters written [to Christians], helping them to know
how to live their lives for Christ Jesus after they are saved from
their sins. They were not arranged in chronological order so to
read and learn from them as God intended, it is better to follow
the order of the Simple Reading Schedule. This way each letter
will build upon each other. You will also have some preparation
before you read Romans, a very intense letter. Each letter deals
with specific issues and problems that different groups of
Christians were struggling with at the time of the writing. The
most common problem was that Jewish false teachers were
binding the Gentile Christians under the Law. However, up
front, the Law, spoken of in the letters is in a very generalized
way as &#8220;Law&#8221; vs. &#8220;the Law&#8221; most often. It is the old covenant
of God, the Old Testament from Genesis through Malachi.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The first nine letters are written by the apostle Paul to
specific congregations of the Lord’s body in various cities and
are named for the area in which those Christians lived. The next
four letters are written by Paul to specific Christian individuals
who were working with congregations.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The letter to the Hebrews was written to help Jewish
Christians understand that the Old Testament had fulfilled its
purpose in pointing people to something much better: Christ
Jesus.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The letters of James, 1 and 2 Peter, 1, 2, and 3 John, and
Jude were all written to Christians in various areas, and the
letters are named after the writer.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The book of Revelation is a combination of letters from
Christ Jesus to specific congregations, and a prophecy given as
a reminder to Christians to stay faithful even in persecution
because God is the one ultimately in control.}}

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The Romans had their problems with Jewish Christian false
teachers also. But he first addressed homosexuality which was
a common practice in Rome at the time. Caesar Nero was a
classic example. Paul puts it in blunt terms in 1 Cor. 6:9, “they
will not inherit the kingdom of God.’ In the next few chapters,
Paul deals with: various quotes of the O.T., why they are not the
“faith of Abraham,’ and that Christ was the fulfilment of that
promise to Abraham, long before the O.T. was written. In
chapter 6, Paul gives us one more aspect about immersion, the
death burial, and resurrection, same as our Lord. Chapter 7
shows the contrast of a married couple and remarriage, but the
whole point is you cannot keep the Old Covenant of God and be
married to the New Covenant of Jesus or else God calls you an
adulteress. Paul speaks of his (and our) war between what we
want to do vs. what we are to do in Christ and how nothing but
ourselves can ever keep us the love of God. Chapter 9 goes back
to the argument against the Jewish false* teachers. In 10, the
same problem with the Israel of then and many false religious
groups of today, “a zeal of God, but not according-to
knowledge.’ Then Paul speaks of the declarations/report from
the apostles that brought them to Christ. In 11, Paul speaks that
is was always God’s plan to have the Gentiles and Jews under
one covenant. In Chapters 12-14, instructions on how to live as
a Christian, and governments in Chapter 13. In Chapter15 back
to more about the Law of Moses vs. the Law of Christ. Ending
with Paul’s typical farewells.}}

that God raised him [up] from the dead, you will be
saved; <sup>10:10</sup> for* it is believed in the heart toward

Jesus, that nothing [is] desecrated through itself,
except to the one counting something to be
desecrated, to that [one it is] desecrated. <sup>14:15</sup> But if
your brother is made sorrowful because of food, you
are no longer walking according-to love*. Do not
destroy that [man], on behalf of whom Christ died,

good not to eat meats, nor to drink wine, nor

<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">If you could find a place where sin was rampant, it was
Corinth. Then what was worse is the attitude common to today
of “it really doesn’t matter.’ The more garbage you take in, the
more chance of it influencing you! Then the congregation in
Corinth seems to take everything to the extreme.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">They were not unified in much of anything and filled full of
splits, and the “anything goes’ policy so common to many
religious groups of today. “In the same...’ “be mindful of the
same...’ is a common commandment throughout all the letters;
but not in this congregation. Paul’s use of sarcasm is superior
throughout both Corinthian letters, “Christ sent me not to
immerse, but to proclaim the good-news’ actually both are
commands of the Lord written at the ends of the books of
Matthew, Mark, Luke, witnessed in Acts 2:38 “to be saved.’
Man’s foolishness is used by God to promote His purpose. 4:10,
apostles are foolish, but they (the Corinthians) are wise, and
many more places.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">Then in chapter 2, Paul goes from foolishness of man to
wisdom of man vs. God’s wisdom, which progresses onward to
the spiritual things. Chapter 3, Paul calls them babies and
fleshly. Then he talks about the foundation (Jesus) that he and
Apollos built that they should make sure they build properly on
it. Because even if Paul’s work fails at judgment day (the
Corinthians); Paul is still saved as though he walked through the
fire. In chapter 4 & 9, Paul calls them arrogant, they are judging
him. They have everything, even reigning like kings; they do not
need Paul. In chapter 5, a man is fornicating with his
stepmother. Instead of disciplining him, so he would not spend
eternity away from them; they just do not care. This “leavening’
could ruin the batch of them, and they just do not get it. Then
they have lawsuits against each other. Paul finally lists all of
their past sins (possibly current ones) and tells them no one who
practices them will inherit heaven. The Corinthians thought you
could be like the world and still be in the Lord’s body at the
same time. Chapter 7 deals with marriage and the unmarried.
Then in Chapters 8, 10, they add idolatry to the list. Also in
Chapters 10, 11 it was pointed out how they are abusing the
Lord’s Supper and the love feast versus how it should be
respected. We know from Acts 20:7, this is one of the reasons
the congregations come together every Sunday. Chapters 12, 13,
14 talks about the spiritual gifts Christians had during the first
century used to evangelize the world (Mark 16:15-20). In 13:10,
he tells them the completed word will stop all of this, so put
love higher on the list, it never fails. Once again, the Corinthians
took this to extremes as about everything else they did. In 15,
Adam and Jesus are compared, and the last part talks about the
time when Jesus will come back where “in the blink of an eye’
we will inherit our heavenly bodies. In 16, he concludes with his
typical greetings and encouragements.}}

God was delighted through the foolishness of the

both Jews ask for a sign and Greeks seek wisdom; <sup>1:23</sup>

indeed an offense to [the] Jews, but foolishness to [the]

brethren of the Lord and Cephas? <sup>9:6</sup> Or [is it] only
Barnabas and I [who] have no authority not to work? <sup>9:7</sup>

its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not eat
 from the milk of the flock? <sup>9:8</sup> I am not

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>14:6</sup> But brethren, now if I come to you° speaking in
[foreign] languages, what will I profit you°, if I do not
speak to you° either in revelation or in knowledge or
in prophecy or in teaching? <sup>14:7</sup> Even the lifeless
things give [forth] a voice, whether flute or harp, if it
does not give a distinction in the sounds, how will it
be known what is piped or harped? <sup>14:8</sup> For* if the
trumpet also gives an indistinct voice, who will
prepare [himself] *for war? <sup>14:9</sup> So you° also, if you° do
not give distinct speech through the [foreign] language,
how will it be known what is spoken? For* you° will
be speaking to air. <sup>14:10</sup> If the varieties of [foreign]
voices in the world are so-many, [as] it may be, and [yet]
none of them [are] unintelligible. <sup>14:11</sup> Therefore if I do
not know the power of the voice, I will be a barbarian
to the one who speaks [with it,] and he who speaks [will
be] a barbarian with* me. <sup>14:12</sup> So you° also, since you°
are zealous ones of [the] spirits, seek° in-order-that
you° may abound to the building up of the
congregation*. <sup>14:13</sup> Hence let he who speaks in a
[foreign] language pray in-order-that one may
translate.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>14:14</sup> For* if I pray in a [foreign] language, my spirit
prays, but my mind is unfruitful. <sup>14:15</sup> Therefore what
is it? I will pray with the spirit and I will also pray
with the mind. I will sing-praise with the spirit and I
will also sing-praise with the mind. <sup>14:16</sup> Otherwise if
you give-thanks with the spirit, how will he who fills
the place of the unskilled say the amen upon your
thanksgiving, since he did not know what you are
saying? <sup>14:17</sup> For* you indeed give-thanks well, but the
other is not built up. <sup>14:18</sup> I give-thanks to my God, [I
am] speaking with [foreign] languages more [than] all of
you°. <sup>14:19</sup> But in the congregation*, I wish to speak
five words through my mind in-order-that I might
also instruct others, than ten-thousand words in a
[foreign] language.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>14:20</sup> Brethren, do° not become children in [your]
mindsets, (but be° infants in malice), but become°
mature in [your] mindsets. <sup>14:21</sup> It has been written in
the law, “I will be speaking to this people in different
languages and by other lips, and thus they will not
even hear me, says the Lord.’  <sup>14:22</sup> So-then [foreign] languages are *for a sign, not to the ones
who believe, but to the unbelieving. But prophecy [is
for a sign], not to the unbelieving, but to the
believing. <sup>14:23</sup> Therefore, if the whole congregation*
should come together in the same [place], and [if] all
may be speaking with [foreign] languages, and [if]
unskilled or unbelieving [people] should enter, will
they not be saying that you° are insane? <sup>14:24</sup> But if all
may prophesy and some unbelieving or unskilled
[person] should enter, he is reproved  by
all. He is judged by all. <sup>14:25</sup> And thus, the secret
things of his heart become apparent, and so, having
fallen [down] upon [his] face, he will be worshiping
God, reporting that God really is among you°.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>14:26</sup> Therefore brethren, what is it? Whenever you°
come together, each of you° has a psalm, has a
teaching, has a revelation, has a [foreign] language, has
a translation. Let all things happen toward [your]
building up. <sup>14:27</sup> If anyone speaks in a [foreign]
language, [let it be] according-to two or three [at] the
most and individually, and let one translate. <sup>14:28</sup> But
if there is no translator, let him be silent in the
congregation*, and let him speak to himself and to
God. <sup>14:29</sup> But let° the prophets speak [by] two or three
and let° the others discern. <sup>14:30</sup> But if [a prophesy] is
revealed to another sitting [by], let the first be silent.
<sup>14:31</sup> For* all [of] you° are able to prophesy according-to
one , in-order-that all may learn and
all might be encouraged. <sup>14:32</sup> And the spirits of the
prophets are subject to the prophets; <sup>14:33</sup> for* God is
not [a God] of unrest, but of peace.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">As in all the congregations* of the holy-ones: <sup>14:34</sup>
let° your° women  be silent in the
congregations*; for* it has not been permitted* for
them to speak, but to be subject, just-as the law also
says.  <sup>14:35</sup> And if they wish to learn
anything, let° them ask [their ]own husbands in [their
own] house; for* it is shameful for women 
to speak in a congregation*. <sup>14:36</sup> Or [was it] from you°
[that] the word of God went forth? Or did [it] only arrive
*for you°?
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>14:37</sup> If anyone thinks [himself ]to be a prophet or
spiritual, let him fully know what I write to you°, that
they are the commandments from [the] Lord. <sup>14:38</sup> But
if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>14:39</sup> So-then brethren, be° zealous to prophesy and

saying that there is no resurrection of the dead? <sup>15:13</sup>
But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even
Christ has been raised [up]; <sup>15:14</sup> and if Christ has not
been raised [up], consequently*, our preaching [is] empty
and your° faith [is] also empty. <sup>15:15</sup> Now, we are also
found [to be] false* witnesses of God, because we
testified against God [in saying] that he raised the
Christ [up]; whom consequently*, he did not raise [up],
if indeed* the dead are not raised [up]. <sup>15:16</sup> For* if the

Consequently*, also the ones who fell-asleep in

hoped in Christ in this life only, we are the [most]
pitiful of all men.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>15:20</sup> But now Christ has been raised [up] from the
dead, he became the first-fruit of the ones who have
fallen-asleep. <sup>15:21</sup> For* since death [came] through a
man, the resurrection of the dead also [came] through
a man. <sup>15:22</sup> For* just-like all die in Adam, so all will
also be given-life in Christ. <sup>15:23</sup> But each in [his] own
order: Christ [the] first-fruit; thereafter the ones [who
are] the Christ’s in his presence. <sup>15:24</sup> Thereafter [is] the
end, whenever he gives up the kingdom to the God
and Father; whenever he does-away-with all rule and
all authority and power. <sup>15:25</sup> For* it is essential [for]
him to reign, till which [time] he would have placed all
the enemies under [his] feet.  <sup>15:26</sup> [The] last
enemy done-away-with [is] death. <sup>15:27</sup> For* he
subjected all things under his feet.  But
whenever he says, All things have been subjected, ([it
is ]evident that [is ]outside[ ] the one having
subjected all things to him). <sup>15:28</sup> But whenever all
things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will
also be subjected to the one who subjected all things

sow the body: the one will become, but a naked
kernel, if it might be of wheat or anyone of the rest [of

[glory] of the earthly [is] different). <sup>15:41</sup> [There is ]another

is sown in weakness; it is raised up in power. <sup>15:44</sup> It
is sown a physical body; it is raised up a spiritual
body. There is a physical body, and there is also a
spiritual body. <sup>15:45</sup> So also it has been written, “The
first man Adam became a living soul.’  The

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">Paul continues his battle with those who think of themselves
too highly and states he did not come to them right then to spare
them. He was giving them a chance to repent. About three
chapters are spent showing his authority from Jesus, and how
good they had life in comparison to the apostles’ “verdict’ of
death. In chapter 6 and 11, he talks about how bad the people
who had ministered to the Corinthians had it, but all of it was
for the sake of the Corinthians and others. He gave various
encouragements: all in life is temporary; hope for a new body in
heaven; in salvation, a new creation; you* are in our hearts, etc.
“You* are not distressed by us, but you* are distressed by your*
own affections’ in 6:11 sums it up for them.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">Then Paul describes a relief that many of the congregations
had put together for the poor holy-ones (10:1) in Jerusalem, one
of many mentioned in the New Testament. Many were assigned
and cooperated due to the high possibility of robbers (food
during a drought is more valuable than gold). Then in chapter
10, he redirects his letter to rebuke one or many who claim that
“they walk according-to the flesh.’ He tells the Corinthians they
should have already done it in 10:2. In 11, he talks to the
Corinthians as he did to the Galatians about anyone adding in
another good-news or teaching not in the bible is a false teacher.
Adding in “it doesn’t say not to’ is just as bad as excluding
parts. Paul continues his sarcasm in 12 and then his rebuke in 13
“not sparing’ them when he comes.}}

sparingly, and he who is sowing upon [his] bounties
will also be reaping upon [his] bounties. <sup>9:7</sup> [Let] each

God loves* a joyful giver. <sup>9:8</sup> Now God [is] able to
[make] abound all grace toward you°; in-order-that
having all self-sufficiency in everything, you° should
always abound to every good work; <sup>9:9</sup> as it has been
written, “He scattered [them], he gave to the poor; his
righteousness remains forever.’ <sup>9:10</sup> Now he

food, may supply and may multiply your° seed and
may cause the growth of the fruits* of your°
righteousness. <sup>9:11</sup> You° are enriched in everything to
all liberality, which is working through us
thanksgiving to God. <sup>9:12</sup> Because the service of this
ministry* not only is replenishing the things lacking
of the holy-ones, but is also abounding through many
thanksgivings to God; <sup>9:13</sup> [because] through the trial [of
]you° from this service they are glorifying God upon
[the] subjection of your° confession toward the good-news of the Christ and [at] the liberality of the
generosity toward them and toward all; <sup>9:14</sup> and in
their supplication on your° behalf, a longing-for you°

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The letter is addressed to Christians as is all “letters' and this
time multiple congregations all located in Galatia. Paul wastes
no time getting right to the point that there is only “one good-news of Jesus' and obeying any other is a curse. Apparently,
some previously converted Jew(s) were teaching the previously
converted Gentile Christians that they had to be circumcised and
keep the Old Covenant Laws. A wonderful comparison of the
“promise to’ and the “faith of Abraham’ and “the faith of Christ.’
The real purpose of God was always to bring Christ into the
world. However, Paul with various arguments pretty much put
it in the context in 5:1-6. Circumcision is not profitable, but if
you keep any of the Law (Old Testament), then you have to
practice all of it. However, in Christ, all are free from the Old
Testament Law and Christians are not a slave to it. Then the
typical “slap on the face' from Paul “you* who are made
righteous by the law; you* have fallen from the grace of God.'
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">Therefore, if you are keeping tithing, then you have to keep
the Sabbath (Saturday) and about 630 more laws. Then once
again “who hindered you* not to obey the truth’' I wish-that
those who are unsettling you*  will even castrate themselves. No
doubt, we know Paul’s (God’s) opinion of false teachers who
lead Christians away from the truth by making them keep Old
Testament Law. For* all the Law is fulfilled in one word, in
this: “You will love* your neighbor like yourself’ 5:14.}}

circumcision <sup>2:8</sup> (for* he who worked in Peter to the
apostleship of the circumcision also worked in me to
the Gentiles). <sup>2:9</sup> And having known the grace which
was given to me, James and Cephas and John, (the

fellowship to me and Barnabas, that* indeed we
[should go] to the Gentiles but they [should go] to the

James. But when they came, he was retreating back
and separating* himself, fearing the ones [who are]
from the circumcision. <sup>2:13</sup> And the rest of the Jews
were also hypocrites together-with him; so-then even
Barnabas was led [away] with their hypocrisy. <sup>2:14</sup> But
when I saw that they are not [being ]straightforward
pertaining to the truth of the good-news, I said to
Peter before [them] all, If you, being* a Jew, are living
like-a-Gentile and not like-a-Jew, why are you urging
the Gentiles to [live ]like-a-Jew?
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>2:15</sup> We [are] Jews by nature and not sinners from
the Gentiles; <sup>2:16</sup> knowing that a man is not made

Christ Jesus, in-order-that we might be made

righteous from the works of the law.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>2:17</sup> But if seeking to be made righteous in Christ;
we ourselves were also found [to be] sinners, [is] then

I establish myself [as] a transgressor. <sup>2:19</sup> For* through

Abraham and to his seed. He does not say and to

hundred and thirty years after[ward], is not
invalidating [the] covenant* which has been validated
beforehand by God [in reference] to Christ, *that* it
should do-away-with the promise.  <sup>3:18</sup> For*
if the inheritance [is] from [the] law, [it is] no more from
[the] promise, but God has granted it to Abraham

It was added because of transgressions, till the seed
should come to whom it has been promised; having
been appointed through messengers by the hand of an
intermediary. <sup>3:20</sup> Now the intermediary is not of [just]
one, but God is one. <sup>3:21</sup> Therefore [is the] law against

seem to have few problems, which were so common to the other
congregations of the Lord in his letters, or they had already
learned the truth from them. Paul is still in prison and sends
others in his place to help and encourage them. The introduction
in the first chapter and second about God’s favor; his original
plan for our salvation, all we have to do it obey it. Eph. contains
the most misquoted verse in the Bible by Christians, completely
out-of context, 2:8. God made a plan for us to be saved from our
sins and showed us many examples in Acts. Once saved from
your past sins, Christians have the letters to guide them on how
to stay in God’s grace and receive further forgiveness of sin for
us as the “new creation.’ So many miss this fact. In chapter 3, he
describes God’s plan, a mystery hidden until this age when the
Gentile and the Jew would be together in one body, the
congregation of believers. The absolute best description of what
the body of Christ is supposed to be and follow in Chapter 4:1-6, 11-16. We pray that all “achieve to the unity of the faith and
of the full knowledge of the Son.’ In Chapter 5, Paul uses an
example of a husband and wife to describe Jesus’ love for the
congregation. In Chapter 6, Paul tells us the devil is the real
enemy, and only the knowledge of God’s word can defeat him
and his schemes.}}

very few sentences dealing with problems or possible problems,
one is two women who are making some kind of disturbance.
Paul tells them to be of the same mind a commandment he tells
all the Christians in all his letters. All Christians should strive to
be the congregation, which obeys the commands of Jesus and
not the traditions of men, fulfill Jesus’ prayer for unity, (Joh
17). He speaks about his evangelism of all the palace guard.
You might say he had a “captive audience’ with “the whole
palace guard and to all the rest.’ You get to see a lot of Paul’s
human side, his emotions, and concern for all the congregations
and his desire to make sure someone is sent to them in his place.
Paul does a rebuke to the “mutilation,’ i.e., the Jewish Christian
false teachers in chapter 3. Some of the best advice that could
be given to a Christian, “forgetting the things which are behind
me and stretching forth to the things which are before me.’ He
ends with the usual greeting and encouragements.}}

abiding together-with you° all, *for your° progress and
joy in the faith; <sup>1:26</sup> in-order-that your° boasting may
abound in Christ Jesus in me, through my presence

of the good-news of the Christ; in-order-that, if I
came and saw you° or [even] being absent, I may hear
[about] the things concerning you°, that you° are
standing-firm in one spirit, with one soul contending
together-with [us] in the faith of the good-news. <sup>1:28</sup>

example of destruction, but to you° [is an example] of
salvation and this thing [is] from God, <sup>1:29</sup> because it

<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The Colossians had a “pastor’ problem, a one-man self-righteous false teacher, most likely a Jewish Christian with
“persuasive speech’ who wanted the congregation to follow his
teachings and not the teachings of the Christ given to them by
Paul. There are reasons, as shown here, why God did not
establish a democracy or a dictatorship in the congregation, but
multiple shepherds (overseers, elders, etc. Philippians 1:2, Tim.
3, Titus 1). An inspired description of this man, without naming
him and strong rebuke in Chapter 2:8-23. In this a teaching that
immersion cleaned away their sins, trespasses, and killed the
Old Testament Law “having nailed it to the cross.’ He uses the
same type of example here as he did in Rom 6. In Chapter 3,
now that you have been raised up from the dead do away with
old sinful things and replace them with holy things. Do all in the
name of Jesus; (do only what is authorized). A short
encouragement to the married, children, bondservants
(workers), and employers. Some simple instruction to them and
the plans to send others in his place to continue to help them
grow.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">We can learn a valuable lesson from this letter to never exalt
or follow any man, as well as how to live as a Christian. Hero
worship has no place with Christians and should be condemned

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The letter sent to a congregation in Thessalonica apparently
who had problems with the teachings previously given to them,
which deals with what is typical, called the “Second Coming.’
They believed (wrongly) that Jesus was coming back “like right
now.’ One thing that false religious groups and “self-proclaimed’ (false) prophets have taught us in the past 100 years
or so is that no one knows when Jesus is coming back. Jesus did
not even know. A very vivid picture is given of how the
judgment, revelation of the Lord, Jesus’ coming and the end
occurs. Jesus and the messengers of God would come with a
sound of a trumpet (common in Greek history as a call to battle,
that everyone could hear it) in flaming fire. Christians will meet
Jesus in the air 1Thessalonians 4:16-17, “those who are not
obeying...the sentence of everlasting utter-destruction’ in
2Thessalonians 1:7-9. The warning that the “man of sin’ would
come first, 1Thessalonians 2, Caesar Nero, (called 666 by John
in Revelation 13:18) was a time that Christians would start
suffering persecution from the hands of the Roman government.
A quick “to the point’ conclusion in 2Thessalonians 3 and a
commandment to stay away from those who do not teach “the
tradition received from us.’ A commandment we hope all
Christians will obey by not following the “traditions of men’ and
so save themselves from the “fire.’}}

more. Timothy receives this letter from Paul and Paul took
Timothy with him on other journeys (Acts 16:3-5). However,
the writing is to give instructions and encouragement to
Timothy and all other men who would preach the Good-news
and to stress the necessity of preaching and teaching the sound
doctrine (i.e., the Good-news of Christ, without adding to or
taking away from it). To identify the need to wage the good
spiritual warfare against Satan, including resisting and rebuking
the ones who teach false doctrine. Paul addresses prayer,
submission of women, qualifications of the men for the
eldership or servants such as deacons. We also see instructions
on the proper treatment of older and younger men and women,
including widows and elders. Instruction and strong warning

<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The book of Hebrew gives direction to the Jewish Christians;
building on their common knowledge of Jewish Law and
traditions, the book furthers their comprehension of the
Kingdom of Jesus Christ. Using the Law as a shadow of the
things that have happened in their sight.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">It is important to realize how difficult it was for "Children of
Abraham" to shove aside generations of teachings and the
marvelous acts of God recorded in their history. The miraculous
confirmations happening among them got their attention, but
they must understand all the fulfilling of recorded prophecies.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The author would have referred to the destruction of
Jerusalem had it been written after AD 70, also references in the
present tense is used when speaking of worship in the Temple.
(5.3, 10.1) It probably was written after the first generation of
Christians. (2.3) &#8220;having received it in the beginning when
spoken through the Lord, which was confirmed to us by the
ones who heard it?&#8221; We lean toward the idea that Paul actually
wrote Hebrews and it would have been about 65-66 AD, right
before his death. There have been many speculations on the
authorship, all the way from Paul, Luke, Barnabas, Clement of
Rome, Apollos, and Silvanus. However, what was seen in the
early writings has Paul as the author. We can understand at this
point in life not to have his name inside. However, more
importantly, God is the final authority over His Written Word.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">Hebrews is a book of encouragement, exhortation, but
contains strong warnings. Powerful beginning, &#8220;God, who long-ago spoke, in many parts and in many manners, in the prophets
to the fathers, has in the end of these days, spoken to us in his
Son.&#8220;
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">Hebrews shows the proper relationship between the Old and
New Testaments and explains clearly the Old Testament
passages and ideas. It also demonstrates the superiority of the
Good-news of Jesus’. It was written to prevent apostasy from
Christianity back into Judaism by showing the Good-news is
superior to Judaism (a God-given religion) and by showing
perfection and finality of Christ’s priesthood. Hebrews also
shows how Jesus was the Christ to the non-believer and as the
fulfillment of many Old Testament prophecies. It was a final
attempt for the Jews to be saved before their massacre in the
destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD and the end of the now false
Jewish religion.}}

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>1:8</sup> But [he says] toward the Son[,] “Your throne, [O]

every transgression and disobedience* received a just
reward; <sup>2:3</sup> how will we flee away, having neglected
so-great a salvation, which  having received [at the]
beginning, [which was] to be spoken through the Lord,
it was confirmed to us by the ones who heard [it]? <sup>2:4</sup>
God [was] testifying together-with [them], both with
signs and with wonders and with various powers and
with distributions of [the] Holy Spirit, according-to his
[own] will.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>2:5</sup> For* he did not subject the future inhabited-earth to messengers, concerning what we are
speaking. <sup>2:6</sup> But  some [writer] thoroughly testified
somewhere, saying, “What is man, that you
remember him? Or the son of man, that you visit
him? <sup>2:7</sup> You made him a bit [of] something inferior
[less] than the messengers. You crowned him with
glory and honor. <sup></sup> [And stood him over the works of
your hands.] <sup>2:8</sup> You subjected all things underneath
his feet.’  For* while* he was subjecting all
things to him, he left nothing [which is] not subject to
him. But we now do not yet see all things having
been subjected to him. <sup>2:9</sup> But we see Jesus who has
been made a bit of something inferior, [less] than [the]
messengers, having been crowned with glory and
honor, because of the suffering of the death [he
underwent],*that in the grace from God, he should
taste of death on behalf of everyone. <sup>2:10</sup> For* it was
suitable for him, because of whom [are] all things and
through whom [are] all things, having led many sons
to glory, to complete the author of their salvation
through sufferings. <sup>2:11</sup> For* both the one making [him]
holy and the ones being made holy [are] all from one.
Because of which case, he is not ashamed to call
them brethren, <sup>2:12</sup> saying, “I will be proclaiming your
name to my brethren, in the midst of the
congregation* I will be singing hymns to you.’ <sup>2:13</sup>
And again, “I will have confidence in him.’ And
again, “Behold, [here] I [am] and the children whom
God gave me.’  <sup></sup>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><sup>2:14</sup> Therefore since the children have shared of
flesh and blood, in like-manner he partook of the

the devil; <sup>2:15</sup> and he might set-free these, as many as
[were] in fear of death, who were liable to bondage
through[out] all of the[ir time] to live. <sup>2:16</sup> For* surely he
is not helping messengers, but he is helping the seed
of Abraham. <sup>2:17</sup> Hence he was obligated to be similar
to the brethren according-to all things, in-order-that
he might become a merciful and faithful high-priest

But the word of hearing did not profit them, not
having been mingled together-with the faith in those
who heard [it]. <sup>4:3</sup> For* we who believed are entering
into the [same] rest; just-as he has said, “<span style="font-weight: bold">As I have
sworn in my wrath, [that] they will never* be
entering into my rest,’ although the works [have]
happened from the conception of the world. {See
Footnote on 3:11.} <sup>4:4</sup> For* he has thus said somewhere
concerning the seventh [day], “And God rested on the
seventh day from all his works’;  <sup>4:5</sup> and
again in this one, <span style="font-weight: bold">['That] if they will be entering into
my rest.’   <sup>4:6</sup> Therefore, since
it is left [for] some to enter into it, and the ones who
were proclaimed the good-news  beforehand [have] not
entered [into it ]because of disobedience, <sup>4:7</sup> he again
determines a certain day [as ]today, saying in David,
after so-much time, (just-as it has been said
[beforehand]), “Today if you° hear his voice, do not
harden your° hearts.’  <sup>4:8</sup> For* if Joshua had
given-rest [to] them, he would have not been speaking
concerning another day after these things. <sup>4:9</sup>
Consequently*, a Sabbath-rest is left for the people of
God. <sup>4:10</sup> For* the one who entered into his rest, he
also rested from his works, just-like God [did] from his
own. <sup>4:11</sup> Therefore let us be diligent to enter [into] that
rest, in-order-that not anyone should fall in[to] the
same example of disobedience.

judge of [the] contemplations and deliberations of [the]

tribe upon whom these things are said, from which
no one has taken-heed to the altar. <sup>7:14</sup> For* [it is]
evident that our Lord has risen [up] out-of Judah; [as] to
which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning the
priesthood. <sup>7:15</sup> And [what we say] is still even-more
evident, if there stands up a different priest,

has become, not according-to [the] Law of a fleshly
commandment, but according-to the power of an
indestructible life; <sup>7:17</sup> for* he testifies[,] “You [are ]a

a nullifying of the preceding commandment because
of its weakness and unprofitableness <sup>7:19</sup> (for* the law
completed nothing) and a bringing* in of a better
hope, through which we are drawing near to God. <sup>7:20</sup>
And inasmuch as [it is] not without an oath, for* the
ones who indeed have become priests are [so] without
an oath, <sup>7:21</sup> but he, with an oath through the one who

enter into [the] [holy of ]holies made* with hands,

<sup>10:20</sup> a fresh and living way which he inaugurated for

[having] a great priest over the house of God; <sup>10:22</sup> let
us come near with a true* heart in full assurance of
faith, [our] hearts having been sprinkled away from an

hold-onto the confession of hope unwavering; for* he

sacrifice is left no more [for us] concerning sins, <sup>10:27</sup>
but a certain fearful expectancy of judgment and a
zeal of fire being about to eat the adversaries. <sup>10:28</sup>
Anyone, having rejected [the] Law of Moses, dies
without mercies upon [the word of] two or three
witnesses.  <sup>10:29</sup> How-much worse
punishment, do you° think he will be deemed worthy
of, [after] having trampled down the Son of God, and
having deemed the blood of the covenant* in which
he was made holy [as] common, and having insulted
the Spirit of grace? <sup>10:30</sup> For* we know the one who
said, “Vengeance [is] for me. I will be repaying says
[the] Lord.’ And again, “[The] Lord will judge his
people.’  <sup>10:31</sup> [It is] a fearful
thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

a large conflict of sufferings; <sup>10:33</sup> [in] this thing indeed,
being made a spectacle both by reproaches and
afflictions, but [in] this thing, you° became partners of
the ones who are conducting themselves so. <sup>10:34</sup> For*
you° also sympathized together-with [me] in my bonds,
and you° accepted the ravening of your° possessions
with joy, knowing [that] you° have for yourselves a
better possession in the heavens and an abiding [one].
<sup>10:35</sup> Therefore do° not cast away your° boldness,
which has great reward. <sup>10:36</sup> For* you° have need of

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">This letter was most likely written about the same time the
letter in Acts 15 was sent to all the congregations from the
apostles in Jerusalem. That letter told the Gentile Christians and
the Jewish Christians that only four things from the Law (Old
Testament) were to be obeyed. Jews who had known the Law all
of their lives could not keep it, no way Gentiles could either and
neither has to obey it under the New Testament.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">So James is fast paced written to an overall Christian
audience and encourages all to not have a “faith only,’ or a
“works can save you’ type attitude but to have both. James has
more commandments (short and simple) per page than does any
other letter: Do not be a hearer only but be a doer. To believe
(have faith) is to have works. Do not blame God for your lack
of control. Listen. Practice mercy. Do not be prejudiced. Do not
ignore the poor, etc. The classic “faith only’ can never save you
rebuke because even “demons believe’ is in 2:19. James tells us
how to live as Christians. He tells us “like it is.’}}

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">He writes in categorical, almost dogmatic, terms. There is no
disputing the truth of what he says. He condemns error in no
uncertain terms! With the rising interest in a merging of
Christianity with the higher forms of paganism, there was a
pressing need for the presentation of adequate Christian
knowledge to combat the danger. Nowhere else in the New
Testament is the combination of faith, love, and obedience so
clearly brought out. The letter was written to a group of people,
with whom the author was personally acquainted and who were
threatened with the same infiltration of false teachings. The
writing is from Ephesus. Major themes in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd John
are the assurance of salvation. One of John’s main purposes in
1 John is to give believers assurance (1 John 5:13), and the need
for assurance is needed by all Christians, especially true* for
new converts. The Bible rejects the false teaching of “ once
saved always saved,’ but it does not reject the biblical doctrine
of assurance.}}

<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The book of Revelation was written before 66 AD, the start
of the invasion by Vespasian and his son Titus toward
Jerusalem. If it had been written after the destruction of
Jerusalem, that would have been mentioned in the book since
that was God’s Judgment Day upon the Jews and a great
example about what happens to false teachers or religious
groups who claim to be 'God's people'.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The book was written during the time when Christians were
not only being persecuted by the Jews but also from the Roman
government by one of the vilest men to walk on this earth,
Caesar Nero. The entire book is written in extremely symbolic
language, and O.T. like arrangement (not chronological). This
was like a code that the Christians would understand, but the
Jews and Romans would never see God’s judgment on the
Jewish nation coming. This would keep them safe and give them
hope during this extreme time of Nero (the man 666) and while
seeing the deadly advance of Roman armies (Luk 21:20)
reserved to put an end to the various Jewish rebellions which
had plagued Roman rule for over a decade, once and for all.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">Through the symbolic language, you have a historical “play
by play’ of what is going to take place with the eventual fall of
Jerusalem, which took 3.5 years. It even prophesies of the
stopping of the advance also foretold in Luke 21, so no single
Christian lost their life in the 3.5-year massacre (Josephus) and
the final destruction of the Jewish temple and all its records,
thus fulfilling every unfulfilled prophecy of the Old and New
Testament. The armies were led by the soon to be Caesar
Vespasian and then his son Titus after apostle Paul’s execution
by Nero and then Nero’s death in June 68 AD. Even though
Revelation is a symbolically written history book from 1 to
20:11, it still gives every Christian hope because we know that
God always wins!
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">Revelation contains the chapter (20:1-7) most often
mistranslated to meet certain beliefs more than any other place
in the Bible, (the 'abolish' in Mat 5:17 is second). If you have to
change what the Word of God says to promote your doctrine,
then your doctrine cannot possibly be God’s doctrine. The final
warning from God, “do not add to or take away from’ God’s
word in 22:19. People who “add’ or “remove’ things in worship
or the Word of God as it is preached, should take-heed and
know they are taking a chance with their souls and need to
repent.}}

the four cornered city is laid, and the length [is] as the

furlongs, twelve thousand [and] twelve [furlongs], the

Lamb are her temple. <sup>21:23</sup> And the city has no need of

<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The purpose of the MLV is not financial gain. We
have removed many traditional renderings and
transliterated words by translating them unless they
are “thus saith the Greek’ such words as: angel,
baptism, baptize, baptist, blessed, church, doctrine,
gospel, saint, and satan. We will not be putting them
back in for Money’s sake. People need to learn what
God really said and pitch out “traditions of men’ and
“church.’ Even much of our formatting is non-traditional. We care more about what is inside than
making the MLV a pretty accessory for your Sunday
suit or dress. The MLV is dedicated to removing 600
years of “traditions of men’ which are not Greek. We
are [not] sorry that the theologians will have to adjust.

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">One of the best ways to describe the Modern
Literal Version New Testament translation is that it
is the [first] to adopt many significant translation
principles:
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">0. The MLV was never made for money. It is
given away royalty free in foreign countries, a [first] in
the English bible arena, all one has to do is ask for
the print-ready PDF’s to take to any local print shop
(MLVbible@gmail.com).
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">1.The MLV’s intention from day one was to be a
“purer Word of God’ than any other “xyz bible
translation’ and to correct the 600 years of error or
traditions of man found in “xyz’ version. We still see
others not willing to do so.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">2. It was the [first] translation to use the power of
modern computers. All the way back in 1987.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">3. The MLV was the [first] to attempt to keep Greek
uniformity.  A completely “foreign’ concept to
others. (Same Greek word translation into the same
English word(s) whenever possible, same with
phrases and idioms.)
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">4. The MLV was the [first] and [only] to attempt to
keep English uniformity. In other words keeping one
specific English word to represent only one specific
Greek word or one of its meanings. The worst
example probably is the word “[will]’ which is the
translation of 69 different Greek words in the King
James Version. Please note though, that some related
Greek words from the same root will share English
words. If God had intended the New Testament to be
written in 10,000 different words, he would have
written it that way.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">5. The [first] translation that has no contradictions.
The MLV began its journey because of the Mat 5:17
(abolish) vs. Eph 2:15 (abolish) one found in almost
every modern translations; same English word used
for 2 different Greek words. Jesus came to not tear
down the old law but to fulfill it (5:17-18), and then
He abolished it with his death on the cross, thereby
implementing the “New Covenant’ (Eph 2:12-16).
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">6. The MLV was the [first] Bible translation to be
open on the internet for anyone to submit corrections,
updates or help, since 1998 and the [only  ]published
translation to stay open with yearly and web updates.
No bible should have ever been closed, especially in
the computer age.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">7. The MLV is the [first] to be done by a group of
people [not] divided among committees which
instantly creates inconsistent translations. This means
some books in the MLV may have had 40 or more
people look over them for Greek or English
problems. No other translation has had this kind of
manpower devoted to it, about 375 thus far and a
million plus potential proofreaders! For comparison,
the NIV had 3 people per chapter which is about the
normal for all committee translations.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">8. The MLV is the [first] and [only] translation to ever
deal with the word “for,' by translating all the “for’
conjunctions as “because.’ In fact, the MLV renders
more accurately all English and Greek prepositions
because too many Christians have learned error due
to these sloppy translations.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">9. The MLV is the [first] to denote when there is an
update. Almost all other translations make changes
and the name remains the same and occasionally the
copyright dates change.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">10. The MLV is the only bible translation to ever
create books (e-Sword modules, MySword, MyBible,
too) that can be used to correct or verify the MLV.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">Other uncommon translation principles that sets
the MLV apart:
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">A. You&#176; (plural) vs. You (singular). Many insights
are lost because there is no way to know who is being
addressed, a crowd or an individual.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">B. The “Checks & balance system’ of being an
“Open Source’ translation with the possibility of
millions of people watching has kept the MLV pure
from denominational or theological slants. No one
has ever submitted “indoctrinations’ because they
know the next person will just take them out. No
“publisher version’ can ever say that since all were
made for profit!
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">C. 12-13 year old reading level.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">D. All wording is in Modern English, each word
can be looked up at dictionary.com or in a regular
dictionary and you have a “Bible Correct’ meaning.
For example, “mediator’ in Modern English is an
“arbitrator’ a person who works out compromises; if
there is an attribute of God, compromise is not it!
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">E. You have the ability to read the New Testament
in chronological order; start in Mark and continue, or
in a similar fashion by following the enclosed
“Reading Schedule.’
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">F. The MLV translates the transliterated words
which still plague translations by being repeated over
and over because of the “traditions of men.’ For
example “Satan’ is “The Adversary’ and “angel’ is
now “messenger’ (a serious issue because people
didn’t know “messenger’ and “angel’ are from the
same Greek word), etc.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">G. The MLV has actually used a few words which
are transliterations because English uses them with
the same meaning, like “exodus,’ “paradise’ and
“trauma.’
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">H. This is probably the best translation anyone could
use if studying Greek and exegesis studies because of
its uniformity
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">I. The MLV is literal (word-for-word) translation;
other translation styles primarily use paraphrase.
Literal is “God says’ and paraphrase is “The
translators interpret what God said for you.’
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">J. The MLV has gone to extremes to better
translate verb moods, tenses and cases than any other
English Bible translation. Most do a pitiful job of
showing the action conveyed in Greek verbs. Other
versions almost completely miss “perfect tense’ like
“it has been written.’ Other versions make
subjunctive mood verbs future tense verbs; “should
happen’ was never “will happen’ and will never
happen in the MLV (pun intended). (More discussed
below.)

<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 0.005in"><span style="font-weight: bold"><a id="TOC1_40"></a>Verb, Tenses, Moods 
<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 0.005in">[Downfalls of the English Language]
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">Many words in the English language commonly
used are “irregular’ verbs. The &#8220;be verb group’ of
“be, is, was, were, been, being’ has no good “-ing’
form so actions would change from, “I am’ to “I am-ing’ or “we were’ to. “we were-ing’. Because of this,
Greek tenses often share common English wording
especially in participles.  If English “be verbs’ were
correct, aorist participles would be: “was-ing VERB-ed’ vs. “having VERB-ed’ (wording shared with
perfect tense verbs).
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">Another problem is that we just don’t talk that
way. The most annoying ones, 'I am believing’ and 'I
am knowing'. Belief was never a “once and done’ sort
of anything; even “I am having’ is also a problem in
too many contexts. The word 'saved' is a horrid
translation but the best we have and many false
theologies uses this fact. Salvation is not passive or
ever was.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Present Tense Active Indicative verbs have
seldom ever been translated to show action in any
translation before the MLV. The Greek language is
more about action than tense. Typical translation
would be “I go...’ but to bring out what really is being
said in the Bible, the MLV uses (when English will
allow) “I am going’ to denote the action of the verb.
We are [not] sorry the theologians will have to adjust.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Imperfect Tense Active Indicative verbs are the
same as above except past tense type of action “I was
going...’ These are seldom correct in other versions
or ever uniform throughout (less than 40%).
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Subjunctive Mood verbs “[usually state a thing as
conditional, possible (but not accomplished) or
something merely entertained as a thought. It may be
a statement viewed emotionally, as desired, doubted,
or wished.]’ (Roberts Grammar, pg. 130.) Subjunctive
mood verbs have always been a problem in
translations in the past 600 years and have plagued
the MLV as well. These verbs are denoted by the
words “should, may or might’ and are added in front
of them. These subjunctive mood verbs in Greek are
most often preceded by a “conditional particle’ or
some other part of speech (see G302, G1437,
G1437a, G1875, G2579, G3752). These conditional
statements, when translated into English, begin with
words like “if, whoever, whatever, whenever, lest’
and the “should, may or might’ is usually dropped,
(too wordy and confusing for Modern English).
Some of these conditional statements are denoted at
the beginning with “*that’ (G3705), “that*’ or “in-order-that’(G2443). We have translated all of these,
as in Mark 4:27, for the sake of remaining as literal
as possible, even though Modern English would
abbreviate the sentence down to the first “should.’
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">In Greek translation places where subjunctive
mood verbs occur with G3661 are generally changed
to imperative mood (determined by context). An
example is the ending of Mark 5:7 where the demon
is speaking to Jesus and saying: “Do not torment me’
whereas the subjunctive mood would be
meaningless: “You may not torment me.’ Even
though a conditional statement does carry a future
tense feeling, the improper use of “shall’ and “will’
was dropped. (“Shall’ is Old English present tense of
“should’ as well as first person future tense; a current
13 year old has no idea about “shall’ meaning
“should.’) Even though, “should never’ and “should
we give?’ might sound better as “will never’ or “shall
we give?’ we opted to keep subjunctive mood as
such as opposed to making them future tense. “Will’
in modern language, even though “it has not
happened,’ is frequently thought of as “is absolutely
going to take place,’ which would be incorrect in
almost all places. The inspired writers could have
used future tense if that was what they meant. Most
translations would rather sound pretty in about 100
N.T. verses[,  than be  correct].
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Perfect Tense verbs are those which show a
completed action in the past.  “It is written’ in
reference to O.T. scripture should have always been
rendered: “It has been written.’ God wrote it before
Jesus or the apostles said it.  These are seldom
correct in other versions or ever uniform throughout
(less than 40%).
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">These inconsistencies are due to 'it sounds better'[
but still wrong]. We wish the theologians (theorists)
would learn!

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">All that is asked is that you make sure the reader
knows that this is a translation from the English
Modern Literal Version to their language, not directly
translated from the original Greek language.

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">These are the UK spellings of some American
words: allegorised apostatise armour axe dishonour
dishonoured flavourless honour labour longsuffering
neighbour offence recognise travelling worshipping.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">It might also disturb British and Commonwealth
nationals the strange American way of leaving
punctuation inside quotation marks, like so: “This
just isn’t right.’ When you were expecting: “This is
the way to do it’.<span style="font-weight: bold">

<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">In order to highlight some of the issues we have
found with translation accuracy in various Bibles, we
have compiled a chart that compares the amount of
English words translated from the Greek words. By
using a random number generator, we have picked
some of the Strong’s numbers between 1 and 5624
and added G1096 which is the most troublesome
Greek verb we know. Unlike the Theologians who
like comparing by their beliefs or motives, this is
pure Math, without opinions. We hope this will
illustrate our faithfulness to our own guidelines in
making the MLV as accurate as possible:
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">[1. To translate the original language, word-for-word into English. Then to further boost the
accuracy of the MLV, to translate the same Greek
word into as few different English words as possible.
We also do this for English words by not using them
for different Greek words...]
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">[]Specifically, we compare the MLV to the KJV and
the NASB, later the NKJV and ESV were added.
This is simply because they are the only Bibles that
have an easily accessible English to Greek Lexicon
and a Greek to English concordance that we need to
compile this chart, <span style="font-weight: bold">not because they are “the most’
inaccurate. We have now a similar concordance for
the MLV in book form. This concordance with Greek
addition is available in e-Sword or as “The New
Koine Greek Textbook I & II’ on amazon.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">Modern Bibles claim to be accurate, but most do
not even italicize, or otherwise highlight, [supplied
words]. These are words that are not in the Greek, but
are implied by context. The reader should be able to
decide whether or not to include the words of man in
the Word of God. The reader is unable to do this in
any Bible translation that does not highlight supplied
words.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">We believe that the translators should translate the
Greek into English as literally as possible (within the
scope of readability) and should not <span style="font-weight: bold">  commentate,
indoctrinate, or follow man-made tradition. That is,
insert the translator’s opinion on what the verse
means. For example,
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in"><span style="font-weight: bold">John 3:16:
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">For* God so loved* the world, that he gave his only
begotten Son, in-order-that everyone who believes in
him might not perish, but may have everlasting life.
(MLV)
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">“For God loved the world in this way: He gave His
One and Only Son, so that everyone who believes in
Him will not perish but have everlasting life.
(Holman Christian Study Bible)
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">The translators of the HCSB made a conditional
statement (might not perish) into a “proof positive’
statement by a simple verb tense change (will not
perish) and they are not the only ones to have done
this (NASB, NIV, etc.). Also, in the second part,
“may have everlasting life’ was changed to “have
everlasting life.’ Almost all other translations joined
them on that one.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.005in">To keep the chart below simple, only one of the
main base words has been kept; not the various
tenses or plurals or leading verbs. (For example, BE
for all of the: be, is, was, were, and being.)

<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">Bottom line, the MLV is almost 6 times more
accurate than the ESV, 4 times the NASB, 3.5 the
NKJV, 3 times the KJV.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">The first 3 columns, Modern Literal Version,
King James Version and the New American
Standard Bible are from concordances. They are
the most accurate of all. The English Standard
Version came from Logos software and even with a
second revision is low, due to all the paraphrase in
the ESV. The New King James Version came from
Accordance 10; it is high by about 10%. It would
be great if all Bibles could come from multiple
identical sources, but that option is not available
until the publishers do their jobs better. The MLV
wants you to find “thus saith the Greek’ mistakes
so we are providing a complete series of reference
books to help.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">If you have any other translation information or
wish to compile such to add to this chart, please
send it along to mlvbible@gmail.com.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">In conclusion, The King James Version uses
almost 3 times as many words or phrases for the
corresponding Greek words than does the Modern
Literal Version and the “New American Standard
Bible’ 1995 uses over 4 times as many. The “New
King James Version’ falls in between them. The
English Standard Version is bottom of the list due
to all of its paraphrasing. As literal as the King
James Version was, Jay P. Green Sr. in his revision
of the Englishman’s Concordance showed the
English word “will’ (not future tense) was used for
69 different Greek words. So the Modern Literal
Version does meet its claim to be the “world’s most
accurate Bible translation.’

<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 0.005in"><span style="font-weight: bold"><a id="TOC1_45"></a>Why the Byzantine Majority Text?
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">There are about 6000 known manuscripts of the
N.T., none are the original; they are all handwritten
copies. There no way with the majority of them to
know what kind of copyist: clergy,  housewife, 
non-Christian historian, a professional copyist. The
Sinaiticus manuscript (a keystone in higher textual
criticism) was for sure done by an amateur. It has
10+ other attempts to correct it documented. They
are in length from a sentence to an almost complete
Septuagint and N.T. combined together in a codex
(book). They fall into 2 major splits Alexandrian
10%  and Byzantine 90%. For the first 15 centuries
after our Lord’s death the Alexandrian was not
used by the vast majority of religious groups and
very little was done to attempt to figure out what
the original would have looked like. There was no
compilation of multiple texts since most
manuscripts have handwriting (typos) or age
problems.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">The first compile of Koine Greek manuscripts
was done by Erasmus in 1516. It was packed full of
printing press typos. This 1516 version was the
basis of the Tyndale’s translation (the one that was
burned). A revision in 1522, became Tyndale’s
second translation. A revision again by Stephanus
in 1550 in which verses were added. Beza was
done in 1604. The King James Version supposedly
used the 1604 version and a couple more revisions
of what is commonly called the Textus Receptus.
These were all Byzantine texts.  They do not
perfectly match the R.P. Byzantine Textform 2018;
Revelation being about &#189; the problems. 
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">In 1796, Griesbach promoted his [unproven]
beliefs into a textual criticism which had two major
flaws, “shorter is better’ and “most unique is
better.’ The “more unique’ manuscripts are also the
most corrupt showing massive copyist error. His
theories with more “theory of evolution’ like
arguments, “older is better’ being one, has become
what is commonly called the “Higher Textual
Criticism’ of today. But the computer age has
proven over a billion times copyists delete so the
“short is better’ is a lie.  The other “more unique’ is
also a lie, God does not have error in His Book. 
Mark 1:2 in the Higher Textual Criticism is a bible
contradiction regardless of all the “smoke and
mirrors’ they can muster up! When your theories
make Bible contradictions, then the theory is
wrong, but they keep refusing to adopt better
theories. 
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">Again, going back to the computer age, if you
had 90 hospital records that agreed well with each
other vs. 10 that do not agree at all with each other,
which are you going to use? The Byzantine
majority text may not be the best compilation that
mankind can ever produce but for sure it is in a
better agreement with all manuscripts not just the 6
or so Alexandrian type manuscripts which makes
up 90% of the “Higher Textual Criticism’ final
compilation. This compilation can be as much as
6800 differences from the mass majority
(Byzantine) with many contradictions! The other
fact often neglected is only good manuscripts
would be copied, corrupt ones would stay on the
shelf to rot or be buried away so they would never
be used. We will never buy a 'house built on sand'
(i.e. the higher textual criticism). 
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">In 2017, it was decided to review the MLV all
the way through to make sure the Greek translation
was correct and make sure nothing had been
overlooked. Much to our surprise (and
disappointment) we had missed translating
multiple words; we had made “shorter is better’
mistakes ourselves. We found 2 places in which we
lost our place and added in 2 words in the whole
N.T. Since 1999, everything MLV has been on
modern computers and with modern lighting; we
once again proved “shorter is better’ is a hoax.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">If you wanted to make sure your “Last Will and
Testament’ was available to all after your death,
would you produce 5500 or 500 of them for safe
keeping?
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">The omission of Acts 8:37 in modern texts
including the R.P. Byzantine Textform, has been
reinserted into the MLV on the research of James
Snap Jr.
<p style="margin-left: 0.005in">Our conclusion is, when it comes to “Higher
Textual Criticism’ text translations, “pitch the baby
with the bath water.’ [No] way to fix 6800 mistakes
which could be as many as 10,000 English words.

English word to substitute; the context determines

1450 are compounds of two words that should be
translated the same or very similarly as if the two
