Ay, in their distress they will be waiting full early at my door
<h4 id="ho-6">Israel’s short-lived and shallow repentance</h4>

<p>
Back to the Lord! will be their cry; 
salve he only can bring, that wounded us; hand that smote us shall heal. 
Dead men today and tomorrow, on the third day he will raise us up again, to live in his presence anew. Acknowledge we, cease we never to acknowledge the Lord, he will reveal himself, sure as the dawn, come back to us, sure as the rains of winter and spring come back to the earth. 
</p>

<p>
What way will serve with you, men of Ephraim? Juda, what way will serve? Ruth of yours is but momentary, fades like the early mist, like morning dew.
What wonder I should send prophets first, to shape men to my will if they could, and then utter my sentence of ruin? Believe me, this doom of yours shall be clear as daylight. 
A tender heart wins favour with me, not sacrifice; God’s acknowledging, not victim’s destroying; 
</p>

<h4 id="ho-11">God’s love despised: his vengeance</h4>
