<h2 id="ch1">Chapter 1</h2>

<p>
[The] beginning of the good-news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 
As it has been written in the prophets, “Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will be preparing your way”. 
“The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord; make* his paths straight”. 
John came*, immersing* in the wilderness and preaching the immersion* of repentance into [the] forgiveness of sins. 
And all the region of Judea and [those from] Jerusalem were travelling out to him, and all were being immersed* by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. 
Now John was eating locusts and wild honey, having clothed himself with camel’s hair, and a leather belt around his loin. (1:1–6)
</p>

<p>
And he was preaching, saying, “He is coming after me, the mightier [one than I]. I am not sufficient, having stooped [down], to loose the strap of his shoes. 
I indeed immersed* you° in water, but he himself will immerse* you in [the] Holy Spirit. (1:7–8)
</p>

<p>
And it happened in those days, [that] Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was immersed* by John into the Jordan. 
And immediately coming-up from the water, he saw the heavens being split-apart, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him. 
And a voice came* out-of the heavens, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am delighted”. (1:9–11)
</p>

<p>
And immediately the Spirit cast him forth into the wilderness. 
And he was there in the wilderness [for] forty days, being tempted by the Adversary, and he was with the beasts, and the messengers were serving him. (1:12–13)
</p>

<p>
Now after John was given up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the good-news of the kingdom of God, 
and saying, “The time has been fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn near. Repent and believe in the good-news”. (1:14–15)
</p>

<p>
Now walking beside the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, [who are] Simon’s [sons], casting a net in the sea; for* they were fishermen. 
And Jesus said to them, “Come-here after me and I will make* you to become fishermen of men”. 
And immediately they left their nets [and] followed him. 
And having advanced a few [metres] from there, he saw James and John his brother, the [sons] of Zebedee, and they [were] in the ship mending the nets. 
And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee with the hired-servants in the ship [and] went after him.  (1:16–20)
</p>

<p>
And they travel into Capernaum, and he immediately entered into the synagogue on the Sabbath [and] was teaching. 
And they were being astounded at his teaching; for* he was teaching them like [one] having authority and not like the scribes. (1:21–22)
</p>

<p>
And a man was in their synagogue, in [him was] an unclean spirit, and he cried out, 
saying, “Ah! What [is this thing] with us and with you, Jesus [the] Nazarene? Did you come to destroy us? I know you, [I know] who you are, the Holy One of God”. (1:23–24)
</p>

<p>
And Jesus rebuked it, saying, “Hush and come forth out-of him”. (1:25)
</p>

<p>
And the unclean spirit went forth out-of him, having convulsed him and having cried out with a loud voice. 
And they were all amazed, so-then [they began] to debate together-with themselves, saying, “What is this thing? What new teaching [is] this that he commands even the unclean spirits according-to [God’s] authority, and they are obeying* him?”. (1:26–27)
</p>

<p>
Now the report of himwent forth immediately, into the whole region around Galilee. (1:28)
</p>

<p>
And immediately, they came forth out-of the synagogue, [and] they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 
Now Simon’s mother-in-law was reclining, fevered, and immediately they speak to him concerning her. 
And he came near [and] lifted her up, having taken-hold of her hand, and immediately the fever left her and she was serving them. (1:29–31)
</p>

<p>
Now [after] it became evening, when the sun set, they were bringing to him all who have an ill[ness] and the ones being demon-possessed. 
And the whole city was being gathered together [next] to the door. 
And he healed many having an ill[ness] with various diseases, and cast forth many demons, and he was not allowing the demons to speak, because they knew him. (1:32–34)
</p>

<p>
And exceedingly [early], having risen* up in the morning, [while yet] at night, he came forth and went away into a desolate place, and he was praying there. 
And Simon, and the ones with him, pursued him; 
and having found him, they say to him, “All are seeking you”. (1:35–37)
</p>

<p>
And he says to them, “We should be proceeding into the next towns in-order-that I should also preach there, for* I have come *for this [purpose]”. 
And he was preaching and casting forth demons in their synagogues in the whole [of] Galilee. (1:38–39)
</p>

<p>
And a leper comes to him, pleading with him, and kneeling [down] to him and saying to him, “If you are willing, you are able to cleanse me”. (1:40)
</p>

<p>
Now Jesus, having compassion on [him], stretched out his hand, touched him and says to him, “I am willing. Be cleansed”. 
And having said [that], the leprosy immediately went away from him and he was cleansed. 
And having scolded him, he immediately put him forth, 
and says to him, “See [that] you say nothing to anyone, but proceed-away; show yourself to the priest, and offer the thing which Moses commanded concerning your cleansing *for a testimony to them”. 
But he went forth and began to preach [it] much, and to broadcast the word, so-then he [Jesus] was no longer able to openly enter into [the] city, but was outside in desolate places, and they were coming to him from everywhere.
