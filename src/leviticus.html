<h4 id="lv-19">Worship (19:1–37)</h4>

<h4 id="lv-14">Purification of lepers (14:1–32)</h4>

<p>
The Lord also told Moses, 
“This is the ceremonial to be used when a leper is to be pronounced no longer unclean. He must needs present himself before the priest; 
the priest, therefore, will go out of the camp to find him, and if it appears that leprosy no longer defiles him, 
he will tell him what offerings to make by way of purgation for himself. These are, two living birds, of such a kind as may be used for food, cedar-wood, and scarlet stuff, and hyssop. 
One of the birds must have its blood shed over spring water held in an earthenware pot; 
the one which is left alive must be dipped (together with the cedar-wood, the scarlet stuff, and the hyssop) into the dead bird’s blood, 
and with this the priest must sprinkle the defiled man seven times, to effect his due cleansing. Then the living bird must be allowed to fly away into the open. 
And now the man must wash his clothes, shave the hair on his body, and bathe in water; so purified, he will enter the camp, but on the condition that he does not go into his tent for a whole week. 
On the seventh day he must shave all his hair, head and beard and eyebrows and all, and he must wash again, both his clothes and his body.
</p>

<p>
“On the eighth day he will take two lambs and a yearling ewe, all without blemish, three tenths of a bushel of flour, kneaded with oil, for a bloodless offering, and a pint of oil besides. 
The priest who is pronouncing him clean will bring him into the divine presence, together with these gifts of his, at the door of the tabernacle which bears record of me; 
and there he will take one of the lambs and offer it as a victim for wrong done. He will take the pint of oil, too, and all the rest, and hold them up in the Lord’s presence. 
The lamb must be immolated on holy ground, where the offerings for faults and the burnt-sacrifices are offered; and the victim for wrong done, like the victim for a fault, becomes the property of the priest; it is set apart for holy uses. 
The priest will take some of the blood from this victim which is offered for wrong done, and set a mark with it on the man he is pronouncing clean; on the tip of his right ear, his right thumb, and the great toe of his right foot. 
Then he will take some of the oil in his left hand, 
dip a finger of his right hand in it, and sprinkle it seven times in the Lord’s presence. 
The rest of the oil in his left hand he will use to anoint the man he is cleansing; over the victim’s blood smeared on ear and finger and toe, 
and finally on his head.
</p>

<p>
So he will intercede for him in the Lord’s presence, and offer, first a sacrifice for his fault, then a burnt-sacrifice; 
this he will put on the altar, with its accompanying gifts, and so the man will be duly declared clean.
</p>

<p>
If he is poor, and cannot lay his hand on all the victims aforesaid, he must bring a lamb by way of offering for wrong done, with which the priest will make intercession for him, the tenth of a bushel of flour, kneaded with oil, for a bloodless offering, and a pint of oil, 
and two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, one by way of offering for his fault, and the other as a burnt-sacrifice. 
These he will bring before the priest at the tabernacle door in the divine presence, on the eighth day of the cleansing. 
The priest will take the lamb, the offering for wrong done, and the pint of oil, and hold them up together; 
then he will immolate the lamb, and set a mark with its blood on the man he is pronouncing clean, on the right ear, the right thumb, the great toe of the right foot. 
Then he will take some of the oil in his left hand, 
dip in his right hand, sprinkle the oil seven times in the Lord’s presence, 
anoint the stains on ear, thumb and toe, 
and pour the rest of the oil in his hand over the head of the man who is being cleansed, to win him the Lord’s favour again. 
Finally he will offer the two birds, whether turtle-dove, or young pigeon; 
one of them as for a fault and one by way of burnt-sacrifice, together with the gifts that accompany it.
</p>

<p>
Such is the offering to be made by a leper who cannot afford the full price of his cleansing.
