<h2>I. The Birth and Infancy of Jesus</h2>

<h4>The ancestry of Jesus (1:1–17)</h4>

A record of the ancestry from which Jesus Christ, the son of David, son of Abraham, was born.

<div class=indented>

<p>Abraham was the father of Isaac, <br />
Isaac of Jacob, <br />
Jacob of Juda and his brethren; <br />
Juda of Phares and Zara, by Thamar; <br />
Phares of Esron, <br />
Esron of Aram, <br />
Aram of Aminadab, <br />
Aminadab of Naasson, <br />
Naasson of Salmon; <br />
Salmon of Booz, by Rahab; <br />
Booz of Obed, by Ruth; <br />
Obed of Jesse; <br />
and Jesse was the father of king David. 
</p>

<p>
And king David was the father of Solomon, by her that had been the wife of Urias. <br />
Solomon was the father of Roboam, <br />
Roboam of Abias, <br />
Abias of Asa, <br />
Asa of Josaphat, <br />
Josaphat of Joram, <br />
Joram of Ozias, <br />
Ozias of Joatham, <br />
Joatham of Achaz, <br />
Achaz of Ezechias, <br />
Ezechias of Manasses, <br />
Manasses of Amon, <br />
Amon of Josias; <br />
and Josias was the father of Jechonias and his brethren, <br />
at the time of the removal to Babylon.
</p>

<p>
And after the removal to Babylon, <br />
Jechonias was the father of Salathiel, <br />
Salathiel of Zorobabel, <br />
Zorobabel of Abiud, <br />
Abiud of Eliacim, <br />
Eliacim of Azor, <br />
Azor of Sadoc, <br />
Sadoc of Achim, <br />
Achim of Eliud, <br />
Eliud of Eleazar, <br />
Eleazar of Mathan, <br />
Mathan of Jacob, <br />
and Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary; <br />
it was of her that Jesus was born, who is called Christ.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">[1]</a>
</p>

</div>

<p>
Thus there are fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the captivity in Babylon, and fourteen from the captivity in Babylon to Christ.
</p>


<h4>The virginal conception of Christ (1:18–25)</h4>

<p>
And this was the manner of Christ’s birth. 
His mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, but they had not yet come together, when she was found to be with child, by the power of the Holy Ghost. 
Whereupon her husband Joseph (for he was a right-minded man, and would not have her put to open shame) was for sending her away in secret. 
But hardly had this thought come to his mind, when an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take your wife Mary to yourself, for it is by the power of the Holy Ghost that she has conceived this child; and she will bear a son, whom you shall call Jesus, for he is to save his people from their sins.” 
All this was so ordained to fulfil the word which the Lord spoke by his prophet:
</p>

<blockquote>
Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son, <br />
and they shall call him Emmanuel.
</blockquote>

<p>(which means, God with us.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">[2]</a>) 
And Joseph awoke from sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, taking his wife to himself; and he had not known her when she bore a son, her first-born, to whom he gave the name Jesus.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">[3]</a>
</p>

<h4>The visit of the Magi (2:1–12)</h4>

<p>
Jesus was born at Bethlehem, in Juda, in the days of king Herod. 
And thereupon certain wise men came out of the east to Jerusalem, who asked, “Where is he that has been born, the king of the Jews? We have seen his star out in the east, and we have come to worship him”. 
King Herod was troubled when he heard it, and all Jerusalem with him; so that he assembled all the chief priests and learned men among the people, and enquired of them where it was that Christ would be born. 
And they told him, At Bethlehem in Juda; so it has been written by the prophet:
</p>

<blockquote>
And you, Bethlehem, of the land of Juda, <br />are far from the least among the princes of Juda, <br />
for out of you will arise a leader <br />
who is to be the shepherd of my people Israel.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">[4]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Then, summoning the wise men in secret, Herod questioned them closely upon the time of the star’s appearing. 
And he sent them on their way to Bethlehem, saying to them, “Go and enquire carefully for the child, and when you have found him, bring me back word, so that I too may come and worship him”. 
They obeyed the king, and went on their journey; and all at once the star which they had seen in the east was there going before them, until at last it stood still over the place where the child was. 
They, when they saw the star, were glad beyond measure; and so, going into the dwelling, they found the child there, with his mother Mary, and fell down to worship him; and, opening their store of treasures, they offered him gifts, of gold and frankincense and myrrh. 
Afterwards, because they had received a warning in a dream forbidding them to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by a different way. 
</p>

13
As soon as they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and said, Rise up, take with thee the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt; there remain, until I give thee word. For Herod will soon be making search for the child, to destroy him.
14
He rose up, therefore, while it was still night, and took the child and his mother with him, and withdrew into Egypt, where he remained until the death of Herod,
15
in fulfilment of the word which the Lord spoke by his prophet, I called my son out of Egypt.✻
Os. 11.1.
16
Meanwhile, when he found that the wise men had played him false, Herod was angry beyond measure; he sent and made away with all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its neighbourhood, of two years old and less, reckoning the time by the careful enquiry which he had made of the wise men.
17
It was then that the word spoken by the prophet Jeremy was fulfilled:
18
A voice was heard in Rama, lamentation and great mourning; it was Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted, because none is left.✻
Jer. 31.15.
19
But as soon as Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in Egypt in a dream,
20
and said: Rise up, take with thee the child and his mother, and return to the land of Israel; for those who sought the child’s life are dead.
21
So he arose, and took the child and his mother with him, and came into the land of Israel.
22
But, when he heard that Archelaus was king in Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to return there; and so, receiving a warning in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee;
23
where he came to live in a town called Nazareth, in fulfilment of what was said by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.✻
No such prophecy has survived to us. But an obscure village is often regarded by its more important neighbours as typical of an unfashionable or provincial outlook; cf. Jn. 1.46. The prophecy (Is. 53.3) that our Lord would be despised by men was fulfilled when his contemporaries spoke of him scornfully as ‘a prophet from Nazareth’ (like our ‘wise men of Gotham’). Some think the word should be, not Nazarene, but Nazirite; cf. Gen. 49.26.
