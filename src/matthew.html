<h2 id="ch1">Matthew 1</h2>

<p>
[The] book of lineage of Jesus Christ, [the] son of David, [the] son of Abraham: 
Abraham fathered Isaac; and Isaac fathered Jacob; and Jacob fathered Judah and his brethren; 
and Judah fathered Perez and Zerah from Tamar; and Perez fathered Hezron; and Hezron fathered Ram; 
and Ram fathered Amminadab; and Amminadab fathered Nahshon; and Nahshon fathered Salmon; 
and Salmon fathered Boaz from Rahab; and Boaz fathered Obed from Ruth; and Obed fathered Jesse; 
and Jesse fathered David, the king. (1:1–6)
</p>

<p>
And David, the king, fathered Solomon from the [widow] of Uriah; 
and Solomon fathered Rehoboam; and Rehoboam fathered Abijah; and Abijah fathered Asa; 
and Asa fathered Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat fathered Jehoram; and Jehoram fathered Uzziah; 
and Uzziah fathered Jotham; and Jotham fathered Ahaz; and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah; 
and Hezekiah fathered Manasseh; and Manasseh fathered Amon; and Amon fathered Josiah; 
and Josiah fathered Jechoniah and his brethren, at [the time of] the exile of Babylon. (1:6–11)
</p>

<p>
And after the exile of Babylon, Jechoniah fathered Shealtiel; and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel; 
and Zerubbabel fathered Abiud; and Abiud fathered Eliakim; and Eliakim fathered Azor; 
and Azor fathered Sadoc; and Sadoc fathered Achim; and Achim fathered Eliud; 
and Eliud fathered Eleazar; and Eleazar fathered Matthan; and Matthan fathered Jacob; 
and Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, out-of whom was born Jesus, who is called* the Christ. (1:12–16)
</p>

<p>
Therefore, all the generations from Abraham until David [were] fourteen generations; and from David until the exile of Babylon, [were] fourteen generations; and from the exile of Babylon until the Christ, [were] fourteen generations. (1:17)
</p>

<p>
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus: for* his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found holding [a child] in [her] womb from [the] Holy Spirit. 
Now Joseph, her husband, being a righteous [man] and not willing to disgrace her, planned to divorce her secretly. 
But [when] he had contemplated these things, behold, a messenger of the Lord appeared to him according-to a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary [as] your wife for* what was born in her is from [the] Holy Spirit. 
Now she will be bearing a son, and you will call his name Jesus, for* he will be saving his people from their sins”. 
Now this whole thing has happened in-order-that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, 
“Behold, the virgin will be holding [a child] in [her] womb and will be bearing a son, and they will call his name Immanuel”; which is, [after] being translated, ‘God with us’. 
Now having been awakened from his sleep, Joseph did* as the messenger of the Lord commanded him and took his wife to him; 
and did not know her [intimately] until which [time] she bore her firstborn son, and he called his name Jesus. (1:18–25)
</p>

<h2 id="ch2">Matthew 2</h2>

<p>
Now [when] Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise-men from the east came* into Jerusalem, 
saying, “Where is he who was born [the] King of the Jews? For* we saw his star in the east and
came to worship him”. 
Now [after] Herod the king heard it, he was disturbed and everyone [in] Jerusalem with him. And having gathered together all the high-priests and scribes of the people, he was
inquiring with them where the Christ should be born. (2:1–4)
</p>

<p>
Now they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea; for* thus it has been written through the prophet, ‘And Bethlehem, a land of Judah, you are by no means least among the governors of Judah; for* a leader will be coming forth from you, who will be shepherding my people Israel’”. (2:5–6)
</p>

<p>
Then Herod, having called the wise-men secretly, ascertained accurately with them the time of
the star’s appearing. 
And having sent them to Bethlehem, he said, “[When] travelling [on], probe out accurately [the things] concerning the [young] child. 
And whenever you find [him], report to me, *that [after] I [have] gone [there], I also may worship him”. 
Now having heard the king, they travelled [away]. And behold, the star, which they saw in the east, was preceding them until it came and stood above where the [young] child was. 
Now having seen the star, they rejoiced [with] extremely great joy. 
And they came into the house and saw the [young] child with Mary, his mother. They fell [down] and worshipped him. Having opened their treasures, they brought gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh to him. 
And having been divinely-warned according-to a dream not to revisit Herod, they departed into their [own] region through another way. (2:7–12) 
</p>

<p>
Now [after] they themselves departed, behold, a messenger of [the] Lord appears to Joseph according-to a dream, saying, “[After] you [have] raised yourself [up], take the [young] child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I would speak to you [again], for* Herod is about to seek the [young] child to destroy him”. (2:13)
</p>

<p>
Now having raised himself [up], he took the [young] child and his mother [by] night, and departed into Egypt; 
and he was there until the end of Herod; in-order-that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, “I called my son out-of Egypt”. 
Then Herod, having seen that he was mocked by the wise-men, was exceedingly furious, and sent forth [soldiers and] assassinated all the boys who [were] in Bethlehem, and in all her borders, from two years and downward, according-to the time which he [had] ascertained accurately with the wise-men. (2:14–16)
</p>

<p>
Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, “A voice was heard in Ramah, mourning, and weeping, and much anguish, Rachel weeping [for] her children. And she did not wish to be comforted, because they are not [there]”. (2:17–18)
</p>

<p>
But [after] Herod died*, behold, a messenger of the Lord appears according-to a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 
saying, “[After] you [have] raised yourself [up], take the [young] child and his mother, and travel into the land of Israel, for* the ones seeking the [young] child’s life have died”. 
Now he raised himself [up] and took the [young] child and his mother and came into the land of Israel. 
But [after] he heard that Archelaus is reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and having been divinely-warned according-to a dream, he departed into the parts of Galilee, 
and he came [and] dwelt in a city called* Nazareth; *that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, that he will be called a Nazarene. (2:19–23)
</p>

<h2 id="ch3">Matthew 3</h2>

<p>
Now in those days John the Immerser* comes*, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, 
and saying, “Repent; for* the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near”. (3:1–2)
</p>

<p>
For* this one is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, “A voice [is] crying in the wilderness, ‘prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight’”. 
Now John himself had his [outer] clothing [made] from camel’s hair and a leather belt around his loin, and his nourishment was locusts and wild honey. 
Then Jerusalem and everyone [in] Judea and everyone [from] the region around the Jordan were travelling out to him. 
And they were being immersed* by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins. (3:3–6)
</p>

<p>
But [after] he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming upon his immersion*, he said to them, “Offsprings of vipers, who warned you to flee from the future wrath? 
Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance. 
And do not think to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham [for] father’; for* I say to you, that God is able to lift up children out-of these stones for Abraham. 
But even already, the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which is not producing good fruit is cut off and cast into the fire. (3:7–10)
</p>

<p>
“I indeed immerse* you in water toward repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier [than] I, whose shoes I am not sufficient to bear. He will immerse* you in [the] Holy Spirit; 
whose winnowing fan [is] in his hand, and he will be thoroughly cleansing his threshing floor, and he will be gathering his grain into the barn, but the chaff he will be burning up with unquenchable fire”. (3:11–12)
</p>

<p>
Then Jesus comes* from Galilee to John, to be immersed* by him in the Jordan. 
But John was preventing him, saying, “I have need to be immersed* by you and you are coming to me?”. (3:13–14)
</p>

<p>
But Jesus answered [and] said to him, “Allow [it] now; for* thus it is suitable for us to fulfill every righteousness”. Then he allows him. (3:15)
</p> 

<p>
And Jesus, [after] he was immersed*, came-up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon him; 
and behold, a voice [came] out-of the heavens, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am delighted”. (3:16–17)
</p>

<h2 id="ch4">Matthew 4</h2>

<p>
Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 
And having fasted forty days and forty nights, later he hungered. 
And the Tempter came near [and] said to him, “If you are the Son of God, speak, in-order-that these stones may become bread”. (4:1–3)
</p>

<p>
But he answered [and] said, “It has been written, ‘Man will not be living upon bread alone, but upon every declaration travelling through the mouth of God!‘”. (4:4)
</p>

<p>
Then the devil takes him into the holy city. And he stands him upon the pinnacle of the temple, 
and says to him, “If you are the Son of God, cast yourself downward; for* it has been written that ‘He will be commanding the messengers concerning you, and they will be lifting you up upon [their] hands, lest you hit your foot to a stone’”. (4:5–6)
</p>

<p>
Jesus said to him, “Again it has been written, ‘Do not test the Lord, your God’”. (4:7)
</p>

<p>
Again, the devil takes him to an exceedingly high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; 
and he says to him, “I will be giving you all these things, if you worship me, [when] you [have] fallen short”. (4:8–9)
</p>

<p>
Then Jesus says to him, “Proceed behind me, Adversary! For* it has been written, ‘You will worship the Lord your God and you will give-divine service to him only’”. Then the devil leaves him, and behold, messengers came and were serving him. (4:10–11)
</p>

<p>
Now Jesus, having heard that John was given up, departed into Galilee. (4:12)
</p>

<p>
And having left Nazareth, he came [and] dwelt at Capernaum, the [area] by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali; 
in-order-that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, 
“The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond-that of the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, 
the people who sit in darkness saw a great light and to the ones who sit in the region and shadow of death, light rose [up] for them”. (4:13–16)
</p>

<p>
From then [onward], Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent; for* the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near”. (4:17)
</p>

<p>
Now walking beside the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon who is called* Peter and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for* they were fishermen. 
And he says to them, “Come-here after me and I will make* you fishermen of men”. 
Now immediately, they left the nets and followed him. 
And having advanced from there, he saw two other brothers, James, the [son] of Zebedee and John, his brother, in the ship with Zebedee, their father, mending their nets. And he called them. 
Now immediately they followed him having left the ship and their father. (4:18–22)
</p>

<p>
And Jesus was proceeding around the whole [of] Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good-news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every illness among the people. 
And the report of him went forth into the whole [of] Syria and they brought to him all the ill[ness], holding various diseases and being held with torments and being demon-possessed and being epileptic and paralytics, and he healed them. 
And large crowds followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond-that of the Jordan. (4:23–25)
</p>

<h2 id="ch5">Matthew 5</h2>

<p>
Now having seen the crowds, he went-up into the mountain. And [after] he himself sat down, his
disciples came to him. (5:1)
</p>

<p>
And he opened his mouth [and] was teaching them, saying: 
“The poor in spirit [are] fortunate, because theirs is the kingdom of the heavens. 
The ones who are mourning [are] fortunate, because they themselves will be comforted. 
The meek [are] fortunate, because they themselves will inherit the earth. 
The ones who hunger and are thirsty [for] righteousness [are] fortunate, because they themselves will be fully-fed. 
The merciful [are] fortunate, because they themselves will be shown-mercy. 
The clean in heart [are] fortunate, because they themselves will be seeing God. 
The peacemakers [are] fortunate, because they themselves will be called sons of God. 
The ones who have been persecuted because of righteousness are fortunate, because theirs is the kingdom of the heavens. 
You are fortunate whenever they reproach and persecute you and say every evil word against you, lying, because of me. 
Rejoice and be glad, because your reward [is] much in the heavens; for* thus, they persecuted the prophets who [were] before you. (5:2–12)
</p>

<p>
“You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt is flavourless, [then] with* what will it be salted? It is still not strong-enough [to be used] *for anything, except to be cast outside and to be trampled down by men. 
You are the light of the world. A city laying upon a mountain is not able to be hidden. 
Nor are they burning a lamp and placing it under a peck-container, but upon the lamp-stand, and it is shining to all who are in the house. 
So let your light shine before men, *that they may see your good works and may glorify your Father, the [one] in the heavens. (5:13–16) 
</p>

<p>
“Do not suppose that I came to tear-down the law or the prophets. I came, not to tear-down, but to fulfill. 
For* assuredly I am saying to you, until heaven and earth would pass away, one iota or one serif should never pass away from the law, until all things would become [fulfilled]. (5:17–18)
</p>

<p>
Therefore, whoever should loosen one of these least commandments and should teach men [to do] so, will be called least in the kingdom of the heavens, but if he should practice and should teach [them], this one will be called great in the kingdom of the heavens. 
“For* I am saying to you, that if your righteousness does not abound more-than [that] of the scribes and Pharisees, you should never enter into the kingdom of the heavens. (5:19–20)
</p>

<p>
“You [have] heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Do not murder’, but ‘Whoëver should
murder, he will be liable to the judgement’. 
But I am saying to you, that everyone who is vainly angry to[ward] his brother will be liable to the judgement, and if he should say to his brother, ‘Empty-head’, will be liable to the council, but whoever says, ‘Fool’, will be liable to the hell of fire. (5:21–22)
</p>

<p>
“Therefore, if you should be offering your gift at the altar, and [while you are] there, you should remember that your brother has something against you, 
leave your gift there before the altar and proceed away. First be reconciled to your brother and then [when] you [have] come [back], offer your gift. 
Be agreeable with your opponent quickly, until which [time] you are with him on the road; lest the opponent should give you to the judge and the judge should give you to the attendant and you will be cast into prison. 
Assuredly I am saying to you, You should never come forth from there, until you should repay the last copper-coin. (5:23–26)
</p>

<p>
“You [have] heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery’. 
But I am saying to you, that everyone who is looking [at] a woman in order to lust-after her already committed adultery with her in his heart. 
Now if your right eye is offending you, pluck [it] out and cast [it] from you; for* it is advantageous for you, that* one of your members should perish and not [that*] your whole body should be cast into hell. 
And if your right hand is offending you, cut it off and cast [it] away from you; for* it is
advantageous for you, that* one of your members should perish and not [that*] your whole body
should be cast into hell. (5:27–30)
</p>

<p>
“Now it was said that, ‘Whoëver divorces his wife, let him give her a [document of] divorcement’. 
But I am saying to you, that whoever divorces his wife, except-for [the] reason of
fornication, is making* her commit adultery and whoever marries [her] who has been divorced is
committing adultery. (5:31–32)
</p>

<p>
“Again, you [have] heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘You will not perjure yourself, but will be giving your oaths to the Lord’.
But I am saying to you, literally not to swear; neither in the heaven, because it is the throne of God; 
nor in the earth, because it is the footstool of his feet; nor toward Jerusalem, because it is the city of the Great King, 
nor should you swear in your head, because you are not able to make* one hair white or black. 
But let your word be, a ‘Yes’, yes; a ‘No’, no; and the thing which is more-than these, is from the evil [one]. (5:33–37)
</p>

<p>
“You [have] heard that it was said, ‘An eye in exchange-for an eye and a tooth in exchange-for a tooth’. 
But I am saying to you, not to stand against an evil [man], but who[ever] will slap you upon the right jaw, turn also the other to him. 
And to the one willing to have a lawsuit with you and [wants] to take your tunic, [then] also allow for him [to take] your outer-garment. 
And [the one] who will compel you [to go] one mile, proceed with him two. 
Give to the one who asks you and do not turn away from the one who wishes to borrow from you. (5:38–42)
</p>

<p>
“You [have] heard that it was said, ‘You will love* your neighbor and hate your enemy’. 
But I am saying to you, love* your enemies, speak well of the ones who curse you, do* good [things] to the ones who hate you and pray on behalf of the ones railing at you and [the ones] persecuting you. 
[Do this] *that you may become sons of your Father [who is] in the heavens, because his sun rises upon the evil and the good and [it] rains upon the righteous and the unrighteous. 
For* if you love* the ones who love* you, what reward do you have? Do not even
the tax collectors do* the same? 
And if you only greet your friends, what are you doing* more-than [others]? Are not even the tax collectors doing* so? 
Therefore you will be complete, just-like your Father is complete, the [one] in the
heavens. (5:43–48)
</p>

<h2 id="ch6">Matthew 6</h2>

<p>
“Take-heed not to do* your charity before men, in order to be seen by them, but otherwise you have no reward from your Father, the [one] in the heavens. (6:1)
</p>

<p>
“Therefore, whenever you are doing* charity, do not sound [a trumpet] before you just-like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the lanes, *that they may be glorified by men. Assuredly I am saying to you, They are fully having their reward. 
But [when] doing*  charity, do not let your left [hand] know what your right [hand] is doing*, 
*that your charity may be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will be repaying
you openly himself. (6:2–4)
</p>

<p>
“And whenever you pray, do not be just-like the hypocrites, because they love to pray, standing in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets, *that they may appear [devout] to men. Assuredly I am saying to you, that they are fully having their reward. 
But you, whenever you pray, enter into your storeroom, and [after] you [have] locked your door, pray to your Father in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will be repaying you openly. 
And [while] praying, do not be repetitious just-like the Gentiles; for* they think that they will be heard in their many words. 
Therefore, do not be similar to them, for* your Father knows which things you have need of before you ask him. (6:5–8)
</p>

<p>
”Therefore you, pray thus: our Father, the [one] in the heavens, let your name be made holy. 
Let your kingdom come. Let your will happen as in heaven, also upon the earth. 
Give our supersubstantial bread to us today. 
And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors. 
And do not bring us into temptation, but rescue us from the evil [one]. Amen.
For* if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also be forgiving you. 
But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father be forgiving your trespasses. (6:9–15)
</p>

<p>
“Now whenever you fast, do not become just-like the hypocrites, [with] a gloomy face; for* they disfigure their faces, *that they may appear to men [to be] fasting. Assuredly I am saying to you, they are fully having their reward. 
But [when] you [are] fasting, anoint your head and wash your face 
*that you should not appear [to be] fasting to men, but to your Father [who is] in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will be repaying you. (6:16–18)
</p>

<p>
“Do not store up treasures upon the earth for you, where moth and rust ingest, and where thieves burrow through [your wall] and steal. 
But store up treasures for you in heaven, where neither moth nor rust ingest, and where thieves do not burrow through nor steal. 
For* where your treasure is, your heart will also be there.  (6:19–21)
</p>

<p>
“The lamp of the body is the eye, therefore if your eye is clear, your whole body will be radiant. 
But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. Therefore, if the light which is in you is darkness, how-much [greater] is the darkness! (6:22–23)
</p>

<p>
“No one is able to serve* two lords, for* either he will hate the one and will love* the other; or he will hold to one and will despise the other. You are not able to serve* God and money. (6:24)
</p>

<p>
“Because of this, I am saying to you, do not be anxious for your life, what you may eat and what you may drink; nor [for] what you may clothe your body with. Is not the life [worth] more-than the nourishment and the body [worth more-than] the clothing? 
Look at the birds of the heaven, that they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father is nourishing them. Are you not rather carrying more-value-than them? 
Now who out-of you is able to add one cubit upon his stature [by] being anxious? 
And why are you anxious concerning clothing? Learn from the lillies of the field, somehow they are growing; they are not labouring, nor are they spinning. 
But I am saying to you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these. 
But if God so dresses-up the grass of the field, which is [here] today and the next-day is cast into the oven, [will he] not much more [clothe] you? Small faith [ones]! (6:25–30)
</p>

<p>
“Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What  should we eat?’ or, ‘What should we drink?’ or, ‘What should we dress ourselves [in]?’. 
For* the Gentiles are seeking after all these things; for* your heavenly Father knows that you have needs of all these things. 
But first seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. 
Therefore do not be anxious *for the next-day; for* the next-day will be anxious [enough for] the things of itself. Its evil [is] enough [for] the day. (6:31–34)
</p>

<h2 id="ch7">Matthew 7</h2>

<p>
“Do not judge, in-order-that you might not be judged! 
For* in what judgement you judge, you will be judged and in what measure you measure, it will be measured to you. 
And why are you looking at the speck, the one in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the beam in your [own] eye? 
Or how will you say to your brother, ‘allow [me, that] I may cast forth the speck away from your eye’, and behold, the beam in your [own] eye? 
You hypocrite, first cast forth the beam out-of your [own] eye, and then you will see precisely to cast forth the speck away from your brother’s eye. (7:1–5)
</p>

<p>
“Do not give the holy thing[s] to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before the swine, lest they
trample them down with* their feet and having turned, they may rip at you. (7:6)
</p>

<p>
“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will be finding; knock and it will be opened to you. 
For* everyone who is asking, receives; and the one [who is] seeking, finds; and to the one [who is] knocking, it will be opened. 
Or what man is there out-of you, who, if his son asks him for a loaf he will not give him a stone, will he? 
And if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a serpent, will he? 
Therefore if you, being evil, know to give good presents to your children, how-much more will your Father, the [one] in the heavens, be giving good things to the ones who are asking him?  (7:7–11)
</p>

<p>
“Therefore, all things, as many as you would wish that* men should do* for you, so do* also to them; for* this is the law and the prophets. (7:12)
</p>

<p>
“Enter in through the narrow gate, because wide [is] the gate and broad [is] the way, the one leading to destruction and many [people] are the ones [who are] entering through it. 
Why [is it]? Narrow [is] the gate and pressed [is] the way, the one leading to life and few are the ones [who are] finding it. (7:13–14)
</p>

<p>
“But take-heed, [stay] away from false* prophets, who are coming to you in sheep’s clothing, but inside are ravening wolves. 
You will fully know them from their fruits. They do not collect a grape-cluster from thorns or figs from thistles, do they? 
Thus every good tree produces good fruits, but the rotten tree produces evil fruits. 
A good tree is not able to produce evil fruits, nor [is] a rotten tree [able] to produce good fruits. 
Every tree [which is] not producing good fruit is cut off and cast into the fire. 
Consequently*, you will fully know them from their fruits. 
Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord’, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one practicing the will of my Father, the [one] in [the] heavens. 
Many will be saying to me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not: prophesy in your name, and cast forth demons in your name, and practiced many miracles in your name?’. 
And then I will confess to them, I never knew you. Depart from me, the one working the
lawlessness. (7:15–23)
</p>

<p>
“Therefore, everyone who hears these words from me and practices them, he will be similar to a prudent man, who built his house upon the rock; 
and the rain descended and the rivers came [up] and the winds blew and fell before that house, and it did not fall; for* it had been founded upon the rock. 
And everyone hearing these words from me and [who is] not doing* them, will be similar to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand; 
and the rain descended and the rivers came [up] and the winds blew and hit that house and it fell and great was its fall”.  (7:24–27)
</p>

<p>
And it happened, when Jesus completed these words, the crowds were being astounded upon [the basis of] his teaching; 
for* he was teaching them like [one] having authority and not like the scribes. (7:28–29)
</p>

<h2 id="ch8">Matthew 8</h2>

<p>
Now he himself came-down from the mountain; large crowds followed him. (8:1)
</p>

<p>
And behold, a leper came, [and] was worshipping him, saying, “Lord, if you should will [it], you are able to cleanse me”. (8:2)
</p>

<p>
And Jesus, having stretched out his hand, touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed”. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 
And Jesus says to him, “See [that] you should speak to no one, but proceed [on], show yourself to the priest and offer the gift which Moses commanded, *for a testimony to them”. (8:3–4)
</p>

<p>
Now [after] he entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, pleading with him, 
and saying, “Lord, my young-servant, a paralytic, has been put in the house, terribly tormented”. (8:5–6)
</p>

<p>
And Jesus says to him, “I will heal him, [after] I have gone [there]”. (8:7)
</p>

<p>
And the centurion answered [and] said, “Lord, I am not sufficient that* you should enter under my roof, but only speak by word and my young-servant will be healed. 
For* I am a man also under authority, having soldiers under myself and I say to this one, ‘Travel [on]’ and he is travelling [on], and to another, ‘Come’ and he comes, and to my bondservant, ‘Do* this’ and he does* [it]”.  (8:8–9)
</p>

<p>
Now [after] Jesus heard it, he marvelled and said to the ones [who are] following, “Assuredly I am saying to you, not even in Israel, [have] I found so-great a faith. 
But I am saying to you, that many will be coming from the east and the west, and will be reclined with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens; 
but the sons of the kingdom will be cast forth into the outer darkness; the weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be there”. 
And Jesus said to the centurion, “Proceed [on], and as you [have] believed, let it happen for you”. And his young-servant was healed in that hour. (8:10–13)
</p>

<p>
And [after] Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw [that] his mother-in-law had been put [in bed] and fevered. 
And he touched her hand and the fever left her, and she arose and was serving him. 
Now [after] it became evening, they brought to him many demon-possessed and he cast forth the spirits with a word and healed all who holding an ill[ness]; 
*that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, “He himself took our weaknesses and bore the diseases [we had]”. (8:14–17)
</p>

<p>
Now [after] Jesus saw large crowds around him, he commanded [them] to go away beyond-that [area]. 
And one scribe came near to him, [and] said, “Teacher, I will be following you whereëver you go”. (8:18–19)
</p>

<p>
And Jesus says to him, “The foxes have burrows and the birds of the heaven [have] nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere he may bow his head”. (8:20)
</p>

<p>
Now a different [one] of his disciples said to him, “Lord, permit* me first to go away and bury my father”. (8:21)
</p>

<p>
But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their [own] dead”. (8:22)
</p>

<p>
And having stepped into the ship, his disciples followed him. 
And behold, a great squall happened in the sea, so-as [for] the ship to be hidden by the waves, but he was sleeping. 
And the disciples having gone [to him], awakened him, saying, “Save us Lord! We are perishing!”. (8:23–25)
</p>

<p>
And he says to them, “Why are you cowardly? Small faith [ones]!”. Then he raised himself
up [and] rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm happened. (8:26)
</p>

<p>
Now the men marvelled, saying, “What sort of [man] is this, that even the winds and the sea are obeying* him?”. (8:27)
</p>

<p>
And he himself came to the [area] beyond-that into the region of the Gergesenes, two demon-possessed [men] met him, coming forth out-of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so-then not anyone [was able] to prevail [or] to pass through that way. 
And behold, they cried out, saying, “What [is this thing] with us and with you, Jesus, Son of God? Did you come here to torment us before the time?”. 
Now a herd of many swine was being fed from afar, away from them. 
And the demons were pleading with him, saying, “If you cast us forth, permit* us to go away
into the herd of swine”. (8:28–31)
</p>

<p>
And he said to them, “Proceed away!”. Now they came forth and went into the herd of swine and behold, all the herd of swine rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the waters. 
Now the ones who are feeding [them] fled and went away into the city [and] reported all things and [even] the things of the ones being demon-possessed. 
And behold, all the city came forth *for a meeting with Jesus and [after] they saw him, they pleaded [with him] *that he should go-away from their borders. (8:32–34)
</p>

<h2 id="ch9">Matthew 9</h2>

<p>
And he stepped into the ship [and] ferried over and came into [his] own city. (9:1)
</p>

<p>
And behold, they were bringing a paralytic to him, having been put upon a cot, and Jesus saw their faith said to the paralytic, “Child, have courage; your sins have been forgiven to you”. (9:2)
</p>

<p>
And behold, some of the scribes said among themselves, “This one is blaspheming”. (9:3)
</p>

<p>
And Jesus, having seen their contemplations said, “Why are you contemplating evil in your hearts? For* what is easier, to say, ‘Your sins have been forgiven’; or to say, ‘Lift yourself up and walk’? 
But in-order-that you may know that the Son of Man has authority upon the earth to forgive sins (then he says to the paralytic), “[After] you [have] raised yourself [up], lift up your cot and proceed away to your house”. 
And having raised himself [up], he went away to his house. 
Now [after] the crowds saw [it], they marvelled and glorified God, who gave such authority to men.  (9:4–8)
</p>

<p>
And passing by from there, Jesus saw a man, called* Matthew, sitting at a tax-office and he says to him, “Follow me”. And having stood up, he followed him. (9:9)
</p>

<p>
And it happened, [while he was] reclining [at a meal] in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined together-with Jesus and his disciples. 
And [after] the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, “Why is your teacher eating with the tax collectors and sinners?”. (9:10–11)
</p>

<p>
But Jesus having heard it, said to them, “The ones who are strong have no need of a physician, but the ones who have an ill[ness]. 
Now [when] travelling [on], learn what is [meant by], ‘I will [to have] mercy and not sacrifice’. For* I came, not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance”. (9:12–13)
</p>

<p>
Then the disciples of John come near to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but your disciples do not fast?”. (9:14)
</p>

<p>
And Jesus said to them, “The sons of the bridal-party are not able to mourn, inasmuch as the bridegroom is with them, are they? But the days will come, whenever the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will be fasting. 
But no one puts a patch of unshrunk fabric upon an old garment; for* its fullness [shrinks and] lifts away from the garment and a worse split happens. 
Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wineskins burst and the wine is poured out and the wineskins will be destroyed, but they put new wine into new wineskins and both are protected together”. (9:15–17)
</p>

<p>
[While] speaking these things to them, behold, one ruler came to him [and] was worshipping [him], saying, “My daughter [just] now died*. But [after] you [have] gone [to her], lay your hand upon her and she will live”. 
And Jesus raised himself [up and] followed him and his disciples. (9:18–19)
</p>

<p>
And behold, a woman, having [had] a flow of blood [for] twelve years, came near, behind [him and] touched the hem of his garment; 
for* she was saying in herself, “If only I touch his garment; I will be cured”. (9:20–21)
</p>

<p>
Now Jesus having turned, saw her, and said, “Daughter, have courage; your faith has cured you”. And the woman was cured from that hour. (9:22)
</p>

<p>
And [after] Jesus came into the house of the ruler and saw the flute-players and the crowd being in an uproar, 
he says to them, “Depart; for* the girl has not died, but is sleeping”. And they were laughing at him. 
But when the crowd was cast forth, having entered, he took-hold of her hand, and the girl arose. 
And this fame went forth into that whole land. (9:23–26)
</p>

<p>
And Jesus passing by from there, two blind [men] followed him, crying out and saying, “Show-mercy to us, son of David!”. (9:27)
</p>

<p>
Now he came into the house, the blind [men] came to him and Jesus says to them, “you believe
that I am able to do* this?” (9:28)
</p>

<p>
They say to him, “Yes, Lord”. (9:28)
</p>

<p>
Then he touched their eyes, saying, “Let it happen for you according-to your faith. 
And their eyes were opened. And Jesus scolded them, saying, “See [that you] let no one know it. 
But they went forth and broadcasted [about] him in that whole land. (9:29–31)
</p>

<p>
Now [while] they themselves are going forth, behold, they brought a mute man to him being demon-possessed. 
And [after] the demon was cast forth, the mute [man] spoke and the crowds marvelled, saying, “It was never so manifested in Israel”. (9:32–33)
</p>

<p>
But the Pharisees were saying, “He is casting forth demons in [the power of] the ruler of the demons”. (9:34)
</p>

<p>
And Jesus was proceeding around all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good-news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every illness among the people.
Now having seen the crowds, he had compassion concerning them, because they were being bothered [in spirit] and have been tossed [about], like sheep not having a shepherd. 
Then he says to his disciples, “The harvest is indeed large, but the workers [are] few. Therefore beseech of the Lord of the harvest, *that he should put forth workers into his
harvest”. (9:35–38)
</p>

<h2 id="ch10">Matthew 10</h2>

<p>
And having called his twelve disciples, he gave to them authority [over] unclean spirits, so-then [they are able] to cast them forth, and to heal every disease and every illness. (10:1)
</p>

<p>
Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: the first [is] Simon, who is called* Peter and Andrew his brother; James and John his brother, the [sons] of Zebedee; 
Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the [son] of Alphaeus and Lebbaeus who was surnamed Thaddaeus; 
Simon the Canaanite and Judas the Iscariot, who also gave him up [to the Jews]. (10:2–4)
</p>

<p>
Jesus sent forth these twelve [apostles and] commanded them, saying, 
“Do not go into [any] road of the Gentiles and do not enter into [any] city of the Samaritans; 
but travel rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
Now [while you are] travelling, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near’. 
Heal the sick; cleanse the lepers; cast forth demons; you received freely; give freely. 
Do not procure gold, nor silver, nor brass [coins] *for your [money] belts; 
no knapsack *for [your] journey, neither two tunics nor shoes nor staffs; for* the worker is
worthy of his nourishment. 
Now into whatever city or village you enter, probe out who is worthy in it, and abide there until you should go. 
Now [while] entering into the house, greet it. 
And if indeed the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace be returned to you. 
And whoëver should not accept you, nor should hear your words, [while you are] going forth from the house or the city, shake-off the dust from your feet. 
Assuredly I am saying to you, It will be more tolerable [for the] land of Sodom and Gomorrah in [the] day of judgement, than for that city. (10:5–15)
</p>

<p>
“Behold, I am sending you forth like sheep in the midst of wolves; therefore, become prudent
like serpents and harmless like doves. 
But take-heed, [stay] away from men; for* they will be giving you up to councils, and they will be scourging you in their synagogues; 
and you will also be led in front of governors and kings because of me, *for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. 
But whenever they may give you up, do not be anxious how or what you should speak; for* it will be given to you in that hour what you will be speaking. 
For* you are not the one speaking, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
Now brother will be giving up brother to death and the father the child [he has] and children will be standing up against parents and will be slaying them. 
And you will be hated by all [people] because of my name. But he who [has] endured to the end, this one will be saved. 
But whenever they may persecute you in this city, flee into another; for* assuredly I am saying to you, you should never complete the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man should come. (10:16–23)
</p>

<p>
“A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a bondservant above his lord. 
[It is] enough for the disciple that* he should become like his teacher and the bondservant like his lord. If they called the householder Beelzebub, how-much more the kinfolk!
Therefore do not fear them; for* nothing is being hidden, which will not be revealed, and [nothing] secret, which will not be known. 
What I am speaking to you in the darkness, speak in the light, and what you hear in [your] ear, preach upon the housetops. 
And do not [have] fear from the ones who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul, but rather fear the one who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 
Are two sparrows not sold [for] a copper-coin? And not one out-of them will be falling upon the earth without your Father [knowing it]; 
but even the hairs of your head are all being numbered. 
Therefore do not fear, [because] you are carrying more-value-than many sparrows. 
Therefore, everyone who will confess [to be] in me before men, I will also confess [to be] in him before my Father, [who is] in the heavens. 
But whoëver denies me before men, I will also be denying him before my Father [who is] in the heavens. (10:24–33)
</p>

<p>
“Do not suppose that I came to cast peace upon the earth; I came, not to cast peace, but a sword. 
For* I came to pit man against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 
and, ‘A man’s enemies [will be] his [own] kinfolk’.
He who loves [his] father or mother above me is not worthy of me, and he who loves [his] son or daughter above me is not worthy of me. 
And he who is not taking [up] his cross and following after me, is not worthy of me. 
He who [has] found his life will be losing it, and he who [has] lost his life because of me will be finding it. (10:34–39) 
</p>

<p>
“He who accepts you, accepts me; and he who accepts me, accepts the one who sent me. 
He who accepts a prophet in the name of a prophet, will be receiving a reward of a prophet, and he who accepts a righteous [man] in the name of a righteous [man], will be receiving a righteous [man’s] reward. 
And whoever delivers only a cup of cold [water] to drink to one of these little ones, in the name of a disciple, assuredly I am saying to you, he should never lose his reward”. (10:40–42)
</p>

<h2 id="ch11">Matthew 11</h2>

<p>
And it happened when Jesus [had] completed commanding his twelve disciples, he went-away from there to teach and to preach in their cities. (11:1)
</p>

<p>
Now [after] John heard the works of the Christ [while] in prison, he sent two of his disciples 
[and] said to him, “Are you the one [who is] coming, or [should] we expect a different [one]?”. (11:2–3)
</p>

<p>
And Jesus answered [and] said to them, “[After] travelling [back], report to John what you hear and see: 
the blind recover [their] sight and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised and the poor are proclaimed [the] good-news. 
And whoëver is not offended at me is fortunate”. (11:4–6)
</p>

<p>
Now [while] these [disciples] are travelling [on], Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, “What did you go forth into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 
But what did you go forth to see? A man who has been dressed-up in soft garments? Behold, the ones wearing soft [garments] are in royal houses. 
But why did you go forth? To see a prophet? I am saying to you, Yes, and [one who is] more-than a prophet. 
For* this is he, concerning whom it has been written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will be preparing your way before you’. 
Assuredly I am saying to you, A greater [man] has not been raised [up] among those born of women [than] John the Immerser*. 
But he who is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater [than] he. 
But from the days of John the Immerser* until now the kingdom of the heavens suffers-violently and [the] violent ones seize it. 
For* all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. 
And if you are willing to accept [it], he himself is Elijah, who is the one about to come. 
He who has ears to hear, let him hear. (11:7–15)
</p>

<p>
“But to what will be similar to this generation? It is similar to children sitting in the
marketplaces and shouting to their comrades 
and saying, ‘We piped to you and you did not dance. We mourned for you and [yet] you did not grieve for yourselves’. 
For* John came neither eating nor drinking and they say, ‘He has a demon’. 
The Son of Man came eating and drinking and they say, ‘Behold, a man [who is] a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’. 
And wisdom was made righteous from her children”. (11:16–19)
</p>

<p>
Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his miracles [had] happened, because they did not repent. 
“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! Because if the miracles which happened in Tyre and Sidon the ones having happened in you, they would have repented long-ago in sackcloth and ashes. 
However I say to you, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in [the] day of judgement than for you. 
And you, Capernaum, who was exalted to heaven, you will be descending insofar as Hades, because if the miracles which happened in Sodom, the ones having happened in you, they would have remained until today. 
However I say to you, that it will be more tolerable for [the] land of Sodom in [the] day of judgement, than for you”. (11:20–24)
</p>

<p>
Jesus answered [and] said at that time, “I profess you, [O] Father, Lord of heaven and the earth, that you hid these things from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to infants. 
Yes, Father, because thus it became a delight before you. 
All things were given to me by my Father and no one fully knows the Son, except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father fully, except the Son and he to whomever the Son wills to reveal [him].
Come-here to me, all the ones labouring and have been loaded [down], and I will be giving-rest [to] you. 
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, because I am meek and humble in heart and you will be finding rest for your souls. 
For* my yoke is easy and my load is light”. (11:25–30)
</p>

<h2 id="ch12">Matthew 12</h2>

<p>
Jesus travelled [on] the Sabbath through the grainfields at that time, and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck the tops and to eat [them]. 
But the Pharisees, having seen [it], said to him, “Behold, your disciples are doing* what is not legal to practice on the Sabbath”. (12:1–2)
</p>

<p>
But he said to them, “Did you not read what David did*, when he himself hungered and the ones with him; 
how he entered into the house of God and ate the showbread, which was not legal for him to eat, nor the ones with him, [unlawful] except for the priests only? 
Or have you not read in the law, that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and [yet] are crimeless? 
But I am saying to you, that a greater thing [than] the temple is here. 
But if you had known what is [meant by this], ‘I will to have mercy and not sacrifice’, you would not [have] sentenced the crimeless. 
For* the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath”. (12:3–8)
</p>

<p>
And having gone-away from there, he went into their synagogue. 
And behold, there was a man who has a dried up hand. And they asked him, in-order-that they might accuse him, saying, “Is it legal if [one was] to heal on the Sabbath?”. (12:9–10)
</p>

<p>
But he said to them, “What man will there be out-of you, who will have one sheep and if this [one] falls into a ditch on the Sabbath, will he not take-hold of it and lift [it] up? 
Therefore, how-much does a man carry more-value-than a sheep? So-then is it legal to
do* good on the Sabbath?”. (12:11–12)
</p>

<p>
Then he says to the man, “Stretch out your hand”. And he stretched it out, and it was restored [as] healthy as the other. 
But the Pharisees having gone forth, took a council against him, *that they should destroy him. (12:13–14)
</p>

<p>
But Jesus having known [it], departed from there and large crowds followed him, and he healed them all, 
and rebuked them, in-order-that they should not make* him apparent; 
*that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, 
“Behold, my young-servant whom I selected. My beloved in whom my soul was delighted. I will be placing my Spirit upon him and he will be proclaiming judgement to the Gentiles. 
He will not have selfish ambition, nor will he cry out; nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets. 
He will not fracture a bruised reed and he will not quench a smoking wick, until he should cast forth the judgement to victory. 
And the Gentiles will hope in his name”. (12:15–21)
</p>

<p>
Then a blind and mute [man] being demon-possessed was brought to him, and he healed him, so-then the blind and mute [man is able] both to speak and to see. 
And all the crowds were astonished and were saying, “This is not the son of David, is it?”. (12:22–23)
</p>

<p>
But [after] the Pharisees heard it, they said, “This one is not casting forth demons, except in Beelzebub the ruler of the demons”. (12:24)
</p>

<p>
But Jesus knowing their contemplations said to them, “Every kingdom having been divided against itself is made desolate, and every city or house having been divided against itself will not be established. 
And if the Adversary casts forth the Adversary, he was divided against himself. Therefore, how will his kingdom be established? 
And if I cast forth demons in Beelzebub, in whom do your sons cast [them] forth? They themselves will be your judges because of this. 
But if I cast forth demons with* [the] Spirit of God; consequently*, the kingdom of God [has] arrived-unexpectedly upon you. 
Or how is anyone able to enter into the house of the strong [man], and to be ravening through his goods, if he does not first bind the strong [man]? And then he will be ravening through his house. 
He who is not with me is against me and he who is not gathering together with me scatters. 
Because of this, I am saying to you, Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit will not be forgiven to men. 
And whoëver speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him, but whoëver speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, not in the age [which is] now, nor in the future [one]. 
Either make*° the tree good and its fruit good; or make* the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for* the tree is known from the fruit [it has]. 
Offsprings of vipers! How are you, being evil, able to speak good things? For* out-of the
abundance of the heart the mouth is speaking. 
The good man out-of the good treasure [in him], is casting forth good things and the evil man out-of the evil treasure [in him], is casting forth evil things. 
But I am saying to you, that every idle declaration, whatever men speak, they will be giving an account in [the] day of judgment concerning it. 
For* you will be made righteous from your words and you will be sentenced from your words”. (12:25–37)
</p>

<p>
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you”. (12:38)
</p>

<p>
But he answered [and] said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation is seeking after a sign, and a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet; 
for* just-like Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea-creature; so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. (12:39–40)
</p>

<p>
“[The] men [of the] Ninevites will be standing up with this generation in the judgement and will be condemning it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, more-than Jonah [is] here. 
The queen of the south will be arisen with this generation in the judgement and will be condemning it, because she came from the limits of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, more-than Solomon [is] here. (12:41–42)
</p>

<p>
“But the unclean spirit, whenever it goes away from the man, it goes through waterless places, seeking rest and does not find it. 
Then it says, ‘I will return into my house from where I came forth’, and having gone [back], it finds [it] unoccupied, [that] it has been swept and has been adorned. 
Then it travels and takes with itself seven other spirits [more] evil [than] itself and [when] it [has] entered [again], [they] dwell there and the last [state] of that man becomes worse [than] the first. So it will also be to this evil generation”. (12:43–45)
</p>

<p>
But [while he is] still speaking to the crowds, behold, [his] mother and his brethren stood outside, seeking to speak to him. 
Now someone said to him, “Behold, your mother and your brethren are standing outside, seeking to speak to you”. (12:46–47)
</p>

<p>
But he answered [and] said to the one who spoke to him, “Who is my mother? And who are my brethren?”. 
And he stretched out his hand over [toward] the disciples [and] said, “Behold, my mother and my brethren! 
For* whoëver practices the will of my Father [who is] in the heavens, he himself is my brother
and sister and mother”. (12:48–50)

Now in that day, Jesus went away from the house and was sitting beside the sea. 
And large crowds were gathered to [see] him, so-then he stepped onto a ship to sit, and all the crowd stood upon the beach. (13:1–2)
</p>

<p>
And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying: “Behold, the sower went forth to sow; 
and while* he himself was sowing, some which fell beside the road and the birds came and devoured them. (13:3–4)
</p>

<p>
“Now others fell upon the rocky-areas, where it did not have much soil and immediately it rose up because it had no depth of soil; 
and [after] the sun rose, it was burnt, and it dried up because it has no root. (13:5–6)
</p>

<p>
“Now others fell upon the thorns, and the thorns shot-up and choked them. (13:7)
</p>

<p>
“But now, others fell upon the good soil and was giving fruit, which some was a hundred times, but which some was sixty, but which some was thirty. (13:8)
</p>

<p>
“He who has ears to hear, let him hear”. (13:9)
</p>

<p>
And the disciples came near and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”. (13:10)
</p>

<p>
But he answered [and] said to them, “It has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but it has not been given to those [men]. 
For* who[ever] has, to him will be given and he will abound, but who[ever] does not have, even what he has will be taken-away from him. 
Because of this, I speak to them in parables, because seeing, they do not see, and hearing, they do not hear, nor do they understand. 
And the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in them, which says, ‘In hearing you will hear and should never understand, and seeing you will see and should never know; 
for* the heart of this people became-callous and they [have] selectively heard with the[ir] ears and they closed their eyes; lest they should see with the[ir] eyes and should hear with the[ir] ears and should understand with the[ir] heart and should turn again and I will be healing them’.
But your eyes [are] fortunate, because they are seeing, and your ears, because they are hearing. 
For* assuredly I am saying to you, that many prophets and righteous [men] desired to see the things which you are seeing and did not see [them], and to hear the things you are hearing and did not hear [them]. (13:11–17)
</p>

<p>
“Therefore, you, hear the parable of the sower: 
everyone hearing the word of the kingdom and not understanding [it], [then] the evil [one] comes and seizes what has been sown in his heart. This is he who was sown beside the road. (13:18–19)
</p>

<p>
“And he who was sown upon the rocky-areas, this is he who hears the word and immediately [is] receiving it with joy; 
but he does not have root in himself, but is temporary, and [after] affliction or persecution has happened [to him] because of the word, immediately he stumbles. (13:20–21)
</p>

<p>
“And he who was sown into the thorns, this is he who hears the word, and the anxiety of this age and the deception of riches, choke the word and he becomes unfruitful. (13:22)
</p>

<p>
“Now he who was sown upon the good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it; who bears-fruit and produces some a hundred [times], and [some] sixty, and [some] thirty!”. (13:23)
</p>

<p>
He placed another parable before them, saying: “The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man who sows good seed in his field; 
but while* the men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed darnels between [the stalks] of the wheat and went away. 
But when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then [the] darnels also appeared. 
Now the bondservants of the householder came near and said to him, ‘Lord, did you not sow good seed in your field? Therefore, from where have [the] darnels [come]?’. (13:24–27)
</p>

<p>
“Now he said to them, ‘A man, an enemy, did* this’. (13:28)
</p>

<p>
“Now the bondservants said to him, ‘Therefore, do you wish [that after] we have gone away, [that] we will collect them?’. (13:28)
</p>

<p>
“But he said, ‘No; lest [while] collecting [up] the darnels, you may uproot the wheat at the same-time with them. 
Allow both to be grown together until the harvest, and I will be saying to the reapers in [the] time of the harvest, “Collect first the darnels and bind them in bundles in-order-to burn them, but gather together the wheat into my barn”’”. (13:29–30)
</p>

<p>
He placed another parable before them, saying: “The kingdom of the heavens is similar to a kernel of a mustard-seed, which a man took [and] sowed in his field; 
which indeed is least [compared to] all of the [other] seeds, but whenever it is grown, it is greater [than] the herbs and becomes a tree, so-then the birds of the
heaven come and nest in its branches”. (13:31–32)
</p>

<p>
He spoke another parable to them: “The kingdom of the heavens is similar to leaven, which a woman took [and] hid in three three-gallon-containers of flour, until which [time] it was entirely leavened”. (13:33)
</p>

<p>
Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds, and he was not speaking to them without a parable; 
*that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, “I will open my mouth in parables. I will be uttering things which have been hidden from the conception of the world”. (13:34–35)
</p>

<p>
Then Jesus, having left the crowds, went into the house and his disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the darnels of the field”. (13:36)
</p>

<p>
Now he answered [and] said to them, “He who is sowing the good seed is the Son of Man; 
and the field is the world, and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, and the darnels are the sons of the evil [one]; 
and the enemy who sowed them is the devil and the harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are messengers. 
Therefore, just-like the darnels are collected and burned in fire; so it will be in the end of this world. 
The Son of Man will be sending forth his messengers and they will be collecting out-of his kingdom all the offences and the ones practicing lawlessness, 
and will be casting them into the furnace of fire; the weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be there. 
Then the righteous will be shining out like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. (13:37–43)
</p>

<p>
“Again, the kingdom of the heavens is similar to a treasure which has been hidden in the field; which a man having found, he hid, and he proceeds-away and sells all [his] things from his joy, as many things as he has and buys that field. (13:44)
</p>

<p>
“Again, the kingdom of the heavens is similar to a man, [who is] a merchant, seeking beautiful pearls; 
who found one [very] precious pearl, went [and] has sold* all [his] things, as many things as he had, and bought it. (13:45–46)
</p>

<p>
“Again, the kingdom of the heavens is similar to a dragnet, which was cast into the sea and gathered [fish] from every variety; 
which, when it was filled, they hauled it up upon the beach. And having sat [down], they collected the good into containers, but they cast the rotten outside. 
So it will be in the end of the world; the messengers will be going forth and separate* the evil from the midst of the righteous, 
and will be casting them into the furnace of fire; the weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be there”. (13:47–50)
</p>

<p>
Jesus says to them, “Have you understood all these things?”. (13:51)
</p>

<p>
They say to him, “Yes, Lord”. (13:51)
</p>

<p>
Now he said to them, “Because of this, every scribe who was made a disciple to the kingdom of the heavens is similar to a man [who is] a householder, who casts forth out-of his treasure, new and old [things]”. (13:52)
</p>

<p>
And it happened, when Jesus [had] completed these parables, he took off from there. (13:53)
</p>

<p>
And [after] he came into his fatherland, he was teaching them in their synagogue, so-then [for] them to be astounded and to say, “From where [did] this one [receive] the wisdom and the miracles? 
Is this not the son of the carpenter? Is his mother not called* Mary? And his brethren, James and Joses and Simon and Jude? 
And his sisters, are they not all with us? Therefore, from where [did] this one [receive] all these things?”. 
And they were being offended at him. (13:54–57)
</p>

<p>
But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honour, except in his fatherland and in his [own] house”. And he did not do* many miracles there because of their unbelief. (13:57–58)
</p>

<h2 id="ch14">Matthew 14</h2>

<p>
Herod the Tetrarch heard the report of Jesus at that time, 
and said to his young-servants, “This is John the Immerser*; he was raised from the dead, and because of this, the[se] powers are working in him”. 
For* Herod having taken-hold of John, bound him and placed him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife. (14:1–3)
</p>

<p>
For* John said to him, “It is not legal for you to have her”. (14:4)
</p>

<p>
And wishing to kill him, [but] he feared the crowd, because they were holding him [up] as a prophet. (14:5)
</p>

<p>
Now Herod’s birthday-festivities being brought* [together], the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst [of the court] and pleased Herod; 
from where he confessed with an oath to give her whatever she herself might ask for. (14:6–7)
</p>

<p>
Now having been pushed forward by her mother, she says, “Give me the head of John the Immerser* upon a platter here”. (14:8)
</p>

<p>
And the king was sorrowful, but because of the oaths [he said] and [because of] the ones [who were] reclining [at the meal] together-with [him], he commanded it to be given. 
And he sent [and] beheaded John in the prison. 
And his head was carried upon a platter, and given to the girl, and she carried it to her mother. 
And his disciples came near [and] lifted up the body, and buried it, and they went [and] reported to Jesus. (14:9–12)
</p>

<p>
And [after] Jesus heard [it], he departed from there in a ship, privately to a desolate place, and [after] the crowds heard [of it], they followed him on-foot from the cities. (14:13)
</p>

<p>
And [after] Jesus went forth, he saw a large crowd, and he had compassion upon them and healed their sick. 
Now [after] it became evening, his disciples came near to him, saying, “The place is desolate and the hour [has] already passed-away; dismiss the crowds in-order-that [after] they [have] gone away into the villages, they might buy [various] foods for themselves”. (14:14–15)
</p>

<p>
But Jesus said to them, “They have no need to go away; you, give them [food] to eat!”. (14:16)
</p>

<p>
But they say to him, “We do not have [anything] here except five loaves and two fish”. (14:17)
</p>

<p>
Now he said, “Bring them here to me”. 
And he commanded the crowds to recline upon the grass, [and] he took the five loaves and the two fish, having looked up to heaven, he gave-thanks and broke [them]. He gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples [then gave] to the crowds. 
And they all ate and were fully-fed, and they took up what is leftover of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full. 
Now the ones eating were approximately five thousand men, plus women and children. (14:18–21)
</p>

<p>
And immediately, Jesus urged the disciples to step onto the ship, and to precede him to the [area] beyond-that, until which [time] he should dismiss the crowds. 
And having dismissed the crowds, he went-up into the mountain privately to pray. Now [after] it became evening, he was alone there. 
But the ship was already in the midst of the sea, [and] was being tormented by the waves; for* the wind was adverse. 
Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking upon the sea. 
And [after] the disciples saw him walking upon the sea, they were disturbed, saying, “It is an apparition”, and they cried out from [their] fear. (14:22–26)
</p>

<p>
But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, “Have courage; I am [here]; do not be afraid”. (14:27)
</p>

<p>
Now Peter answered to him, [and] said, “Lord, if you are [here], command me to come to you upon the waters”. (14:28)
</p>

<p>
Now he said, “Come”. 
And Peter descended from the ship, and walked upon the waters to go toward Jesus. (14:29–30)
</p>

<p>
But he was afraid, seeing the strong wind, and began to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!” (14:30)
</p>

<p>
Now Jesus immediately stretched out his hand, and grabbed him, and says to him, “Small faith [ones]! In what were you skeptical?”. (14:31)
</p>

<p>
And [after] they themselves stepped into the ship, the wind paused. 
Now the ones [who are] in the ship came [to him and], worshipped him, saying, “You are truly
the Son of God”. (14:32–33)
</p>

<p>
And having ferried over, they came to the land [of] Gennesaret. 
And [after] the men of that place recognised him, they sent [word] into the whole region around that [place] and brought to him all the ones who have an ill[ness], 
and they were pleading with him in-order-that they might only touch the hem of his garment
and as many as touched [it], were cured. (14:34–36)
</p>

<h2 id="ch15">Matthew 15</h2>

<p>
Then the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem come to Jesus, saying, 
“Why are your disciples transgressing the tradition of the elders? For* they do not
wash their hands whenever they eat bread”. (15:1–2)
</p>

<p>
But he answered [and] said to them, “Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? 
For* God commanded, saying, ‘Honour [your] father and [your] mother’. And, ‘He who is speaking evil of [their] father or mother, let him be ended [by the sentence of] death’. 
But you say, ‘Whoëver says to the father or the mother, “[in] whatever you might be profited from me, [it is] a gift [to God]”, and [then] should never honour his father or mother’, 
and [thus] you invalidated the commandment of God because of your tradition. 
[O] hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied well concerning you, saying, 
‘This people are drawing near to me with their mouth, and are honouring me with the[ir] lips, but their heart is distant, faraway from me. 
But they are worshipping me in futility, teaching [as their] teachings the commandments of men’. (15:3–9)
</p>

<p>
And having called the crowd, he said to them, “Hear and understand! 
Not what enters into the mouth desecrates the man, but what is travelling from the mouth, this desecrates the man”. (15:10–11)
</p>

<p>
Then the disciples came near [to] him [and] said, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended [after] they heard the speech of yours?”. (15:12)
</p>

<p>
But he answered [and] said, “Every plant which my heavenly father did not plant will be uprooted. 
Leave them! They are blind guides of [the] blind. Now if the blind guide the blind, both will be falling into a ditch”. (15:13–14)
</p>

<p>
Now Peter answered [and] said to him, “Explain to us this parable”. (15:15)
</p>

<p>
Now Jesus said, “Are you also without understanding at this point?”. 
Are you not yet perceiving, that everything which travels into the mouth is making room in the belly, and is cast forth into the sewer? 
But the things travelling out from the mouth, come forth from the heart, and they desecrate the man. 
For* out-of the heart comes forth evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false* testimonies, blasphemies. 
These things [are] what is desecrating the man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not desecrate the man”. [15:16–20]
</p>

<p>
And Jesus went forth from there, [and] departed into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.
</p>

<p>
And behold, a woman from Canaan went forth from those borders, [and] cried-out to him, saying, “Show-mercy [to] me, Lord, son of David. My daughter is evilly demon-possessed”. 
But he answered her not a word. (15:22–23)
</p>

<p>
And his disciples came near and were asking him, saying, “Dismiss her, because she is crying behind us”. (15:23)
</p>

<p>
But he answered [and] said, “I was not sent, except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel”. (15:24)
</p>

<p>
But she came and worshipped him, saying, “Lord, help me”. (15:25)
</p>

<p>
Now he answered [and] said, “It is not good to take the children’s bread and cast it to the puppies”. (15:26)
</p>

<p>
But she said, “Yes, Lord; for* even the puppies eat from the crumbs, the ones falling from the table of their lords”. (15:27)
</p>

<p>
Then Jesus answered [and] said to her, “O woman, great [is] your faith. Let it happen for you as you will [it]”. And her daughter was healed from that hour. (15:28)
</p>

<p>
And Jesus, having gone-away from there, went beside the sea of Galilee, and he went-up into the mountain [and] was sitting there. (15:29)
</p>

<p>
And many crowds came to him [there], having their [own] lame, blind, mute, crippled and many others with them. They tossed them beside the feet of Jesus, and he healed them; 
so-then [for] the crowds to marvel, seeing the mute speaking; the crippled healthy; the lame
walking; and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel. (15:30–31)
</p>

<p>
Now Jesus called his disciples to him, [and] said, “I have compassion upon the crowd because they already remain with me three days, and do not have what they might eat, and I am not willing to dismiss them starving, lest they might faint on the road”. (15:32)
</p>

<p>
And his disciples say to him, “From where [can we buy] so-many loaves for us in the wilderness, so-then to fully-feed so-great a crowd?”. (15:33)
</p>

<p>
And Jesus says to them, “How-many loaves do you have?”. (15:34a)
</p>

<p>
But they said, “Seven, and a few small-fish”. (15:34b)
</p>

<p>
And he commanded the crowds to lean-back upon the soil. 
And he took the seven loaves and the [few] fish, [and] he gave-thanks [and] broke [them], and gave to his disciples, and the disciples [gave] to the crowd. 
And they all ate and were fully-fed, and they took up what is leftover of the broken pieces, seven baskets full. 
Now the ones eating were [approximately] four thousand men, plus women and children. (15:35–38)
</p>

<p>
And having dismissed the crowds, he stepped into the ship, and went into the borders of Magadan. (15:39)
</p>

<h2 id="ch16">Matthew 16</h2>

<p>
And the Pharisees and Sadducees came near, testing [him, and] asked him to show them a sign from heaven. 
But having answered, he said to them, “[After] it became evening, you say, ‘[It will be] fair-weather; for* the heaven is red’. 
And in the morning, ‘[There will be] a storm today; for* the heaven is red and dismal’. Hypocrites! You indeed know [how] to discern the face of the heaven, but you are not able [to discern] the signs of the times. 
An evil and adulterous generation is seeking after a sign, and no sign will be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet”. And he left them [and] went away. (16:1–4)
</p>

<p>
And his disciples came to the [area] beyond-that, [and] forgot to take bread. 
Now Jesus said to them, “Behold and take-heed, [stay] away from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”. (16:5–6)
</p>

<p>
Now they were reasoning among themselves, saying, “[It is] because we took no bread”. (16:7)
</p>

<p>
Now Jesus having known it, said to them, “Small faith [ones]! Why are you reasoning among yourselves, ‘because you° took no bread’? 
Do you° not yet perceive, nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and you took [up] how-many baskets? 
Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and you took [up] how-many baskets? 
How are you not perceiving that I did not speak to you concerning bread, [but] to take-heed, [stay] away from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?”. 
Then they understood that he did not say to take-heed, [stay] away from the leaven of bread, but [stay] away from the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. (16:8–12)
</p>

<p>
Now after Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he was asking his disciples, saying, “Who do
men say me (the Son of Man) to be?”. (16:13)
</p>
