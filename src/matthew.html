<h2>I. The Birth and Infancy of Jesus</h2>

<h4>The ancestry of Jesus (1:1–17)</h4>

A record of the ancestry from which Jesus Christ, the son of David, son of Abraham, was born.

<blockquote>
Abraham was the father of Isaac, <br />
Isaac of Jacob, <br />
Jacob of Juda and his brethren; <br />
Juda of Phares and Zara, by Thamar; <br />
Phares of Esron, <br />
Esron of Aram, <br />
Aram of Aminadab, <br />
Aminadab of Naasson, <br />
Naasson of Salmon; <br />
Salmon of Booz, by Rahab; <br />
Booz of Obed, by Ruth; <br />
Obed of Jesse; <br />
and Jesse was the father of king David. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
And king David was the father of Solomon, by her that had been the wife of Urias. <br />
Solomon was the father of Roboam, <br />
Roboam of Abias, <br />
Abias of Asa, <br />
Asa of Josaphat, <br />
Josaphat of Joram, <br />
Joram of Ozias, <br />
Ozias of Joatham, <br />
Joatham of Achaz, <br />
Achaz of Ezechias, <br />
Ezechias of Manasses, <br />
Manasses of Amon, <br />
Amon of Josias; <br />
and Josias was the father of Jechonias and his brethren, <br />
at the time of the removal to Babylon.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
And after the removal to Babylon, <br />
Jechonias was the father of Salathiel, <br />
Salathiel of Zorobabel, <br />
Zorobabel of Abiud, <br />
Abiud of Eliacim, <br />
Eliacim of Azor, <br />
Azor of Sadoc, <br />
Sadoc of Achim, <br />
Achim of Eliud, <br />
Eliud of Eleazar, <br />
Eleazar of Mathan, <br />
Mathan of Jacob, <br />
and Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary; <br />
it was of her that Jesus was born, who is called Christ.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">[1]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus there are fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the captivity in Babylon, and fourteen from the captivity in Babylon to Christ.
</p>


<h4>The virginal conception of Christ (1:18–25)</h4>

<p>
And this was the manner of Christ’s birth. 
His mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, but they had not yet come together, when she was found to be with child, by the power of the Holy Ghost. 
Whereupon her husband Joseph (for he was a right-minded man, and would not have her put to open shame) was for sending her away in secret. 
But hardly had this thought come to his mind, when an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take your wife Mary to yourself, for it is by the power of the Holy Ghost that she has conceived this child; and she will bear a son, whom you shall call Jesus, for he is to save his people from their sins.” 
All this was so ordained to fulfil the word which the Lord spoke by his prophet:
</p>

<blockquote>
Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son, <br />
and they shall call him Emmanuel.
</blockquote>

<p>(which means, God with us.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">[2]</a>) 
And Joseph awoke from sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, taking his wife to himself; and he had not known her when she bore a son, her first-born, to whom he gave the name Jesus.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">[3]</a>
</p>

<h4>The visit of the Magi (2:1–12)</h4>

<p>
Jesus was born at Bethlehem, in Juda, in the days of king Herod. 
And thereupon certain wise men came out of the east to Jerusalem, who asked, “Where is he that has been born, the king of the Jews? We have seen his star out in the east, and we have come to worship him”. 
King Herod was troubled when he heard it, and all Jerusalem with him; so that he assembled all the chief priests and learned men among the people, and enquired of them where it was that Christ would be born. 
And they told him, At Bethlehem in Juda; so it has been written by the prophet:
</p>

<blockquote>
And you, Bethlehem, of the land of Juda, <br />are far from the least among the princes of Juda, <br />
for out of you will arise a leader <br />
who is to be the shepherd of my people Israel.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">[4]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Then, summoning the wise men in secret, Herod questioned them closely upon the time of the star’s appearing. 
And he sent them on their way to Bethlehem, saying to them, “Go and enquire carefully for the child, and when you have found him, bring me back word, so that I too may come and worship him”. 
They obeyed the king, and went on their journey; and all at once the star which they had seen in the east was there going before them, until at last it stood still over the place where the child was. 
They, when they saw the star, were glad beyond measure; and so, going into the dwelling, they found the child there, with his mother Mary, and fell down to worship him; and, opening their store of treasures, they offered him gifts, of gold and frankincense and myrrh. 
Afterwards, because they had received a warning in a dream forbidding them to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by a different way. 
</p>

<h4>The flight into Egypt. The massacre of the Innocents (2:13–18)</h4>

<p>
As soon as they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and said, “Rise up, take with you the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt; there remain, until I give you word. For Herod will soon be making search for the child, to destroy him”. 
He rose up, therefore, while it was still night, and took the child and his mother with him, and withdrew into Egypt, where he remained until the death of Herod, in fulfilment of the word which the Lord spoke by his prophet, 
</p>

<blockquote>
I called my son out of Egypt.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">[5]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Meanwhile, when he found that the wise men had played him false, Herod was angry beyond measure; he sent and made away with all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its neighbourhood, of two years old and less, reckoning the time by the careful enquiry which he had made of the wise men. 
It was then that the word spoken by the prophet Jeremy was fulfilled: 
</p>

<blockquote>
A voice was heard in Rama, <br />
lamentation and great mourning; <br />
it was Rachel weeping for her children, <br />
and she would not be comforted, <br />
because none is left.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">[6]</a>
</blockquote>

<h4>From Egypt to Nazareth (2:19–23)</h4>

<p>But as soon as Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in Egypt in a dream, and said: “Rise up, take with you the child and his mother, and return to the land of Israel; for those who sought the child’s life are dead”. 
So he arose, and took the child and his mother with him, and came into the land of Israel. 
But, when he heard that Archelaus was king in Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to return there; and so, receiving a warning in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee; where he came to live in a town called Nazareth, in fulfilment of what was said by the prophets, 
</p>

<blockquote>
He shall be called a Nazarene.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">[7]</a>
</blockquote>

<h2>II. The Kingdom of Heaven Proclaimed</h2>

<h3>A. Narrative Section</h3>

<h4>The preaching of John the Baptist (3:1–12)</h4>

<p>
In those days John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea; 
“Repent”, he said, “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”. 
It was of him that the prophet Isaias spoke, when he said,
</p>

<blockquote>
There is a voice of one crying in the wilderness, <br />
Prepare the way of the Lord, <br />
straighten out his paths.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">[8]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
And he, John, wore a garment of camel’s hair, and a leather girdle about his loins, and locusts and wild honey were his food. 
Thereupon Jerusalem and all Judaea, and all those who dwelt round Jordan, went out to see him, and he baptized them in the Jordan, while they confessed their sins. 
Many of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees came to his baptizing; and when he saw these, he asked them, “Who was it that taught you, brood of vipers, to flee from the vengeance that draws near? 
Come, then, yield the acceptable fruit of repentance; 
do not presume to say in your hearts, ‘We have Abraham for our father’; 
I tell you, God has power to raise up children to Abraham out of these very stones. 
Already the axe has been put to the root of the trees, so that every tree which does not show good fruit will be hewn down and cast into the fire. 
As for me, I am baptizing you with water, for your repentance; 
but one is to come after me who is mightier than I, so that I am not worthy even to carry his shoes for him; 
he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">[9]</a> 
He holds his winnowing-fan ready, to sweep his threshing-floor clean; 
he will gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will consume with fire that can never be quenched.
</p>

<h4>Jesus is baptised (3:13–17)</h4>

<p>
Then Jesus came from Galilee and stood before John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him. 
John would have restrained him; 
“It is I”, he said, “that ought to be baptized by you, and do you come to me instead?”.
</p> 

<p>
But Jesus answered, “Let it be so for the present; 
it is well that we should thus fulfil all due observance”. 
Then John gave way to him. 
So Jesus was baptized, and as he came straight up out of the water, suddenly heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and resting upon him. 
</p>

<p>
And with that, a voice came from heaven, which said, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”. 
</p>

<h4>Temptation in the wilderness (4:1–11)</h4>

<p>
And now Jesus was led by the Spirit away into the wilderness, to be tempted there by the devil. 
Forty days and forty nights he spent fasting, and at the end of them was hungry. 
Then the tempter approached, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, bid these stones turn into loaves of bread”.
</p>

<p>
He answered, ”It is written, 
</p>

<blockquote>
Man cannot live by bread only; <br />
there is life for him in all the words which proceed from the mouth of God.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">[10]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Next, the devil took him into the holy city, and there set him down on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, “If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down to earth; 
for it is written, 
</p>

<blockquote>
He has given charge to his angels concerning you, <br />
and they will hold you up with their hands, <br />
lest you should chance to trip on a stone”.
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus said to him, ”But it is further written, 
</p>

<blockquote>
You shall not put the Lord your God to the proof”.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">[11]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Once more, the devil took him to the top of an exceedingly high mountain, from which he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, and said, “I will give you all these if you will fall down and worship me.
</p>

<p>
Then Jesus said to him, “Away with thee, Satan; it is written, 
</p>

<blockquote>
You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve none but him”.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">[12]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Then the devil left him alone; 
and thereupon angels came and ministered to him.
</p>

<h4>Return to Galilee (4:12–17)</h4>

<p>
After this, hearing of John’s imprisonment, he withdrew into Galilee. 
And now, forsaking the city of Nazareth, he came and settled down in Capharnaum, which is by the sea-shore, in the country of Zabulon and Nephthalim, in fulfilment of what was said by the prophet Isaias:
</p>

<blockquote>
The land of Zabulon and Nephthalim, <br />
on the sea road, beyond Jordan, <br />the Galilee of the Gentiles!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">[13]</a> <br />
The people that abode in darkness <br />
has seen a great light; <br />
for men abiding in a land where death overshadowed them, <br />
light has dawned.
</blockquote>

<p>
From that time onwards, Jesus began to preach; 
“Repent”, he said, “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”.
</p>

<h4>The first four disciples are called (4:18–22)</h4>

<p>
And as he walked by the sea of Galilee, Jesus saw two brethren, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen); 
and he said to them, “Come and follow me; I will make you into fishers of men”. 
And they dropped their nets immediately, and followed him. 
Then he went further on, and saw two others that were brethren, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John; 
they were in the boat with their father Zebedee, repairing their nets, and he called them to him; 
whereupon they dropped the nets and left their father immediately, and followed him.
</p>

<h4>Jesus preaches and heals the sick (4:23–25)</h4>

<p>
So Jesus went about the whole of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and infirmity among the people; 
so that his fame spread throughout the whole of Syria, and they brought to him all those who were in affliction, distressed with pain and sickness of every sort, the possessed, the lunatics, the palsied; 
and he healed them.
And a great multitude followed him, from Galilee and Decapolis, Jerusalem and Judaea, and the country beyond Jordan.
</p>

<h3>B. The Sermon on the Mount</h3>

<h4>The Beatitudes (5:1–12)</h4>

<p>
Jesus, when he saw how great was their number, went up on to the mountain-side; 
there he sat down, and his disciples came about him. 
And he began speaking to them; 
this was the teaching he gave.
</p>

<blockquote>
“Blessed are the poor in spirit; <br />
the kingdom of heaven is theirs. <br />
Blessed are the patient; <br />
they shall inherit the land. <br />
Blessed are those who mourn; <br />
they shall be comforted. <br />
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for holiness; <br />
they shall have their fill. <br />
Blessed are the merciful; <br />
they shall obtain mercy. <br />
Blessed are the clean of heart; <br />
they shall see God. <br />
Blessed are the peace-makers; <br />
they shall be counted the children of God. <br />
Blessed are those who suffer persecution in the cause of right; <br />
the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
</blockquote>

<p>
“Blessed are you, when men revile you, and persecute you, and speak all manner of evil against you falsely, because of me. 
Be glad and light-hearted, for a rich reward awaits you in heaven; 
so it was they persecuted the prophets who went before you.
</p>

<h4>Salt of the earth and light of the world (5:13–16)</h4>

<p>“You are the salt of the earth; 
if salt loses its taste, what is there left to give taste to it? 
There is no more to be done with it, but throw it out of doors for men to tread it under foot. 
</p>

<p>
“You are the light of the world; 
a city cannot be hidden if it is built on a mountain-top. 
A lamp is not lighted to be put away under a bushel measure; 
it is put on the lamp-stand, to give light to all the people of the house; 
and your light must shine so brightly before men that they can see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
</p>

<h4>The fulfilment of the Law (5:17–19)</h4>

<p>
“Do not think that I have come to set aside the law and the prophets; 
I have not come to set them aside, but to bring them to perfection. 
Believe me, heaven and earth must disappear sooner than one jot, one flourish should disappear from the law; 
it must all be accomplished. 
Whoever, then, sets aside one of these commandments, though it were the least, and teaches men to do the like, will be of least account in the kingdom of heaven; 
but the man who keeps them and teaches others to keep them will be accounted in the kingdom of heaven as the greatest.
</p>

<h4>The new standard higher than the old (5:20–48)</h4>

<p>
“And I tell you that if your justice does not give fuller measure than the justice of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
You have heard that it was said to the men of old, ‘You shall do no murder’; if a man commits murder, he must answer for it before the court of justice.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-14" id="noteref-14" epub:type="noteref">[14]</a> 
But I tell you that any man who is angry with his brother must answer for it before the court of justice, and any man who says ‘Raca’ to his brother must answer for it before the Council; and any man who says to his brother, ‘You fool’, must answer for it in hell fire. 
If you are bringing your gift, then, before the altar, and remember there that your brother has some ground of complaint against you, 
leave your gift lying there before the altar, and go home; be reconciled with your brother first, and then come back to offer your gift. 
If any man has a claim against you, come to terms there and then, while you are walking in the road with him; or else it may be that the claimant will hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and so you will be cast into prison. 
Believe me, you shall not be set at liberty until you have paid the last farthing.
</p>

<p>
“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery’. 
But I tell you that he who casts his eyes on a woman so as to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 
If your right eye is the occasion of your falling into sin, pluck it out and cast it away from you; better to lose one part of thy body than to have the whole cast into hell. 
And if your right hand is an occasion of falling, cut it off and cast it away from you; better to lose one of your limbs than to have your whole body cast into hell. 
</p>

<p>
“It was said, too, ‘Whoever will put away his wife must first give her a writ of separation’. 
But I tell you that the man who puts away his wife (setting aside the matter of unfaithfulness) makes an adulteress of her, and whoever marries her after she has been put away, commits adultery.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">[15]</a>
</p>

<p>
“Again, you have heard that it was said to the men of old, ‘You shall not perjure yourself; you shall perform what you have sworn in the sight of the Lord’.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-16" id="noteref-16" epub:type="noteref">[16]</a> 
But I tell you that you should not bind yourselves by any oath at all: not by heaven, for heaven is God’s throne; 
nor by earth, for earth is the footstool under his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king. 
And you shall not swear by your own head, for you have no power to turn a single hair of it white or black. 
Let your word be ‘Yes’ for Yes, and ‘No’ for No; whatever goes beyond this, comes of evil. 
</p>

<p>
“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth’.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-17" id="noteref-17" epub:type="noteref">[17]</a> 
But I tell you that you should not offer resistance to injury; if a man strikes you on your right cheek, turn the other cheek also towards him; 
if he is ready to go to law with you over your coat, let him have it and your cloak with it; 
if he compels you to attend him on a mile’s journey, go two miles with him of your own accord. 
Give to him who asks, and if a man would borrow from you, do not turn away. 
</p>

<p>
“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy’.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-18" id="noteref-18" epub:type="noteref">[18]</a> 
But I tell you, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, pray for those who persecute and insult you, 
that so you may be true sons of your Father in heaven, who makes his sun rise on the evil and equally on the good, his rain fall on the just and equally on the unjust. 
If you love those who love you, what title have you to a reward? Will not the publicans do as much? 
If you greet none but your brethren, what are you doing more than others? Will not the very heathen do as much? 
But you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
</p>

<h4>Almsgiving in secret (6:1–4)</h4>

<p>
“Be sure you do not perform your acts of piety before men, for them to watch; if you do that, you have no title to a reward from your Father who is in heaven. 
Thus, when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in synagogues and in streets, to win the esteem of men. Believe me, they have their reward already. 
But when you give alms, you shall not so much as let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 
so secret is your almsgiving to be; and then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
</p>

<h4>Prayer in secret (6:5–6)</h4>

<p>
“And when you pray, you are not to be like hypocrites, who love to stand praying in synagogues or at street-corners, to be a mark for men’s eyes; believe me, they have their reward already. 
But when you are praying, go into your inner room and shut the door upon yourself, and so pray to your Father in secret; and then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
</p>

<h4>How to pray. The Lord’s Prayer (6:7–15</h4>

<p>“Moreover, when you are at prayer, do not use many phrases, like the heathens, who think to make themselves heard by their eloquence.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-19" id="noteref-19" epub:type="noteref">[19]</a> 
You are not to be like them; your heavenly Father knows well what your needs are before you ask him. 
This, then, is to be your prayer, 
</p>

<blockquote>
Our Father, who art in heaven, <br />
hallowed be your name; <br />
your kingdom come; <br />
your will be done, <br />
on earth as it is in heaven; <br />
give us this day our supersubtantial bread;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-20" id="noteref-20" epub:type="noteref">[20]</a> <br />
and forgive us our trespasses, <br />
as we forgive them that trespass against us; <br />
and lead us not into temptation, <br />
but deliver us from evil. Amen.
</blockquote>

<p>
”Your heavenly Father will forgive you your transgressions, if you forgive your fellow men theirs;
if you do not forgive them, your heavenly Father will not forgive your transgressions either.
</p>

<h4>Fasting in secret (6:16–18)</h4>

<p>
“Again, when you fast, do not show it by gloomy looks, as the hypocrites do. 
They make their faces unsightly, so that men can see they are fasting; believe me, they have their reward already. 
But do you, at your times of fasting, anoint your head and wash your face, 
so that your fast may not be known to men, but to your Father who dwells in secret; and then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
</p>

<h4>True treasures (6:19–21)</h4>

<p>
“Do not lay up treasure for yourselves on earth, where there is moth and rust to consume it, where there are thieves to break in and steal it; 
lay up treasure for yourselves in heaven, where there is no moth or rust to consume it, no thieves to break in and steal. 
Where your treasure-house is, there your heart is too.
</p>

<h4>The eye, the lamp of the body (6:22–23)</h4>

<p>
“The eye is the light of the whole body, so that if thy eye is clear, the whole of your body will be lit up; 
whereas if your eye is diseased, the whole of your body will be in darkness. And if the light which you have in you is itself darkness, what of your darkness? How deep will that be! 
</p>

<h4>God and money (6:24)</h4>

<p>
“A man cannot be the slave of two masters at once; either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will devote himself to the one and despise the other. You must serve God or money; you cannot serve both.
</p>

<h4>Trust in Providence (6:25–34)</h4>

<p>
“I say to you, then, do not fret over your life, how to support it with food and drink; over your body, how to keep it clothed. Is not life itself a greater gift than food, the body than clothing? 
See how the birds of the air never sow, or reap, or gather grain into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them; have you not an excellence beyond theirs? 
Can any one of you, for all his anxiety, add a cubit’s growth to his height?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-21" id="noteref-21" epub:type="noteref">[21]</a> 
And why should you be anxious over clothing? See how the wild lilies grow; they do not toil or spin; 
and yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 
If God, then, so clothes the grasses of the field, which today live and will feed the oven tomorrow, will he not be much more ready to clothe you, men of little faith? 
Do not fret, then, asking, ‘What are we to eat?’ or ‘What are we to drink?’ or ‘How shall we find clothing?’. 
It is for the heathen to busy themselves over such things; you have a Father in heaven who knows that you need them all. 
Make it your first care to find the kingdom of God, and his approval, and all these things shall be yours without the asking. 
Do not fret, then, over tomorrow; leave tomorrow to fret over its own needs; for today, today’s troubles are enough.
</p>

<h4>Do not judge (7:1–5)</h4>

<p>
“Do not judge others, or you yourselves will be judged. 
As you have judged, so you will be judged, by the same rule; award shall be made you as you have made award, in the same measure. 
How is it that you can see the speck of dust which is in your brother’s eye, and are not aware of the beam which is in your own? 
By what right will you say to your brother, ‘Wait, let me rid your eye of that speck’, when there is a beam all the while in your own? 
You hypocrite, take the beam out of your own eye first, and so you shall have clear sight to rid your brother’s of the speck. 
</p>

<h4>Do not profane sacred things (7:6)</h4>

<p>
“You must not give that which is holy to dogs. Do not cast your pearls before swine, or the swine may trample them under foot, and then turn on you and tear you to pieces.
</p>

<h4>Effective prayer (7:7–11)</h4>

<p>
“Ask, and the gift will come; seek, and you shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened to you. 
Everyone that asks, will receive; that seeks, will find; that knocks, will have the door opened to him. 
If any one of yourselves is asked by his son for bread, will he give him a stone? 
If he is asked for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead? 
Why then, if you, evil as you are, know well enough how to give your children what is good for them, is not your Father in heaven much more ready to give wholesome gifts to those who ask him? 
</p>

<h4>The golden rule (7:12)</h4>

<p>
“Do to other men all that you would have them do to you; that is the law and the prophets.
</p>

<h4>The two ways (7:13–14)</h4>

<p>
“Make your way in by the narrow gate. 
It is a broad gate and a wide road that leads on to perdition, and those who go in that way are many indeed; 
but how small is the gate, how narrow the road that leads on to life, and how few there are that find it!
</p>

<h4>False prophets (7:15–20)</h4>

<p>
“Be on your guard against false prophets, men who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but are ravenous wolves within. 
You will know them by the fruit they yield. Can grapes be plucked from briers, or figs from thistles? 
So, indeed, any sound tree will bear good fruit, while any tree that is withered will bear fruit that is worthless; 
that worthless fruit should come from a sound tree, or good fruit from a withered tree, is impossible. 
Any tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire. 
I say therefore, it is by their fruit that you will know them.
</p>

<h4>The true disciple (7:21–27)</h4>

<p>
“The kingdom of heaven will not give entrance to every man who calls me ‘Master, Master’; only to the man that does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 
There are many who will say to me, when that day comes, ‘Master, Master, was it not in your name we prophesied? Was it not in your name that we performed many miracles?’. 
Whereupon I will tell them openly, ‘You were never friends of mine; depart from me, you that traffic in wrong-doing’.
</p>

<p>
“Whoever, then, hears these commandments of mine and carries them out, is like a wise man who built his house upon rock; 
and the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house, but it did not fall; it was founded upon rock. 
But whoever hears these commandments of mine and does not carry them out is like a fool, who built his house upon sand; 
and the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house, and it fell; and great was the fall of it”.
</p>

<h4>The amazement of the crowds (7:28–29)</h4>

<p>
Afterwards, when Jesus had finished these sayings, the multitudes found themselves amazed at his teaching. 
For he taught them, not like their scribes and Pharisees, but like one who had authority.
</p>

<h3>A. Narrative Section: Ten Miracles</h3>

<h4>Cure of a leper (8:1–4)</h4>

<p>
A great multitude followed him when he had come down from the mountain; 
and now, a leper came and knelt before him, and said, “Lord, if it be your will, you have power to make me clean”. 
</p>

<p>
Jesus held out his hand and touched him, and said, “It is my will; be you made clean”. Whereupon his leprosy was immediately cleansed. 
Then Jesus said, “Be sure you do not tell any man of it; rather go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses ordained, to make the truth known to them.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-22" id="noteref-22" epub:type="noteref">[22]</a>
</p>

<h4>Cure of the centurion’s servant (8:5–13)</h4>

<p>
As he entered Capharnaum, a centurion came to him, asking for his aid; 
“Lord”, he said, “I have a servant lying sick at my house, cruelly tormented with the palsy”.
</p>

<p>
Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him”.
</p>

<p>
But the centurion answered, “Lord, I am not worthy to receive you under my roof; my servant will be healed if you will only speak a word of command. 
I too know what it is to obey authority; I have soldiers under me, and I say, ‘Go’, to one man, and he goes, or, ‘Come’, to another, and he comes, or, ‘Do this’, to my servant, and he does it”. 
</p>

<p>
When he heard that, Jesus said to his followers in amazement, “Believe me, I have not found faith like this, even in Israel. 
And this I tell you, that there are many who will come from the east and from the west, and will take their places in the kingdom of God with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, 
while that kingdom’s own sons are cast into the darkness without, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth”. 
And to the centurion Jesus said, “Go then; let it be done to you as your faith foretold”. And at that hour his servant was healed.
</p>

<h4>Cure of Peter’s mother-in-law (8:14–15)</h4>

<p>
And Jesus went into Peter’s house, and found his wife’s mother lying sick there with a fever. 
He touched her hand, and the fever left her, so that she rose up and ministered to them.
</p>

<h4>A number of cures (8:16–17)</h4>

<p>
And when evening came, they brought to him many persons who were possessed; and he cast out the evil spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick, 
in fulfilment of the word spoken by Isaias the prophet,
</p> 

<blockquote>
He took our infirmities upon himself, and bore our sicknesses.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-23" id="noteref-23" epub:type="noteref">[23]</a>
</blockquote>

<h4>Hardships ofthe apostolic calling (8:18–22)</h4>

<p>
And now, seeing how great were the multitudes about him, he gave the word for crossing to the other side. 
Whereupon one of the scribes came to him, and said, “Master, I will follow you wherever you are going”.
</p>

<p>
But Jesus told him, “Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air their resting-places; the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head”.
</p>

<p>
And another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, give me leave to go home and bury my father before I come”.
</p>

<p>
But to him Jesus said, “Do you follow me, and leave the dead to bury their dead.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-24" id="noteref-24" epub:type="noteref">[24]</a>
</p>

<h4>The calming of the storm (8:23–27)</h4>

<p>
So he took ship, and his disciples followed him. 
And suddenly a great storm arose on the sea, so that the waves rose high over the ship; but he lay asleep. 
And his disciples came and roused him, crying, “Lord, save us, we are sinking”. 
</p>

<p>
But Jesus said to them, “Why are you faint-hearted, men of little faith?”. Then he rose up, and checked the winds, and the sea, and there was deep calm. 
</p>

<p>
So that all asked in amazement, “What kind of man is this, who is obeyed even by the winds and the sea?”.
</p>

<h4>The demoniacs of Gadara (8:28–34)</h4>

<p>
So he reached the other shore, in the country of the Gerasenes; and here he was met by two possessed creatures who came out of the rock tombs, so exceedingly fierce that none could pass along that road. 
And at once they cried aloud, “Why do you meddle with us, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?”. 
Some distance away, a great herd of swine was feeding; 
and the devils asked a favour of him; “If you have a mind to cast us out”, they said, “send us into the herd of swine”.
</p>

<p>
He said to them, “Away with you”; and they came out and went into the herd of swine; and with that, all the herd rushed down the cliff into the sea, and perished in its waters. 
The swineherds fled to the city, and there told all that had happened and the story of those who had been possessed. 
And thereupon all the townspeople went out to meet Jesus; and when they found him, they entreated him to leave their country.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-25" id="noteref-25" epub:type="noteref">[25]</a>
</p>

<h4>Cure of a paralytic (9:1–8)</h4>

<p>
So he took ship across the sea, and came to his own city. 
And now they brought before him a man who was palsied and bed-ridden; whereupon Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the palsied man, “Son, take courage, your sins are forgiven”.
</p>

<p>
And at this, some of the scribes said to themselves, “He is talking blasphemously”. 
</p>

<p>
Jesus read their minds, and said, “Why do you cherish wicked thoughts in your hearts? 
Tell me, which command is more lightly given, to say to a man, ‘Your sins are forgiven’, or to say, ‘Rise up, and walk’?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-26" id="noteref-26" epub:type="noteref">[26]</a> 
And now, to convince you that the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins while he is on earth” (here he spoke to the palsied man), “Rise up, take your bed with you, and go home”. 
And he rose up, and went back to his house, 
so that the multitudes were filled with awe at seeing it, and praised God for giving such powers to men.
</p>

<h4>The call of Matthew (9:9)</h4>

<p>
As he passed further on his way, Jesus saw a man called Matthew sitting at work in the customs-house, and said to him, “Follow me”; and Matthew rose from his place and followed him.
</p>

<h4>Eating with sinners (9:10–13)</h4>

<p>
And afterwards, when he was taking a meal in the house, many publicans and sinners were to be found at table with him and his disciples. 
The Pharisees saw this, and asked his disciples, “How comes it that your master eats with publicans and sinners?”.
</p>

<p>
Jesus heard it, and said, “It is not those who are in health that have need of the physician, it is those who are sick. 
Go home and find out what the words mean, ‘It is mercy that wins favour with me, not sacrifice’. I have come to call sinners, not the just”.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-27" id="noteref-27" epub:type="noteref">[27]</a>
</p>

<h4>A discussion on fasting (9:14–17)</h4>

<p>
Then John’s disciples came to him, and asked, “How is it that your disciples do not fast, when we and the Pharisees fast so often?”.</p>

<p>
To them Jesus said, “Can you expect the men of the bridegroom’s company to go mourning, while the bridegroom is still with them? No, the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them; then they will fast. 
Nobody uses a piece of new cloth to patch an old cloak; that would take away from the cloak all its pattern, and make the rent in it worse than before.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-28" id="noteref-28" epub:type="noteref">[28]</a> 
Nor is new wine put into old wine-skins; if that is done, the skins burst, and there is the wine spilt and the skins spoiled. If the wine is new, it is put into fresh wine-skins, and so both are kept safe.”
</p>

<h4>Cure of the woman with a haemorrhage. The official’s daughter raised to life (9:18–26)</h4>

<p>
While he thus spoke to them, it chanced that one of the rulers came and knelt before him, and said, “Lord, my daughter is this moment dead; come now and lay your hand on her, and she will live”. 
So Jesus rose up and went after him, and so did his disciples.
</p>

<p>
And now a woman who for twelve years had been troubled with an issue of blood, came up behind him and touched the hem of his cloak; 
she said to herself, “If I can even touch the hem of his cloak, I shall be healed”.
</p>

<p>
Jesus turned and caught sight of her; and he said, “Have no fear, my daughter, your faith has brought you healing”. And the woman recovered her health from that hour.
</p>

<p>
So Jesus came into the ruler’s house, where he found mourners playing the flute, and the multitude thronging noisily; 
and he said, “Make room there; the child is not dead, she is asleep”; and they laughed aloud at him. 
But when the multitude had been turned away, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she rose up. 
And the story of these doings spread abroad through all the country round.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-29" id="noteref-29" epub:type="noteref">[29]</a>
</p>

<h4>Cure of two blind men (9:27–31)</h4>

<p>
As Jesus was passing further on his way, he was followed by two blind men, who cried aloud, “Son of David, have pity on us”. 
</p>

<p>
These blind men came to him when he had gone into his lodging, and Jesus said to them, “Have you the faith to believe that I can do this?”. 
</p>

<p>
And they said to him, ”Yes, Lord”. 
</p>

<p>
Thereupon, he touched their eyes, and said, “Your faith shall not be disappointed”. 
Then their eyes were opened; and Jesus laid a strict charge on them, telling them, “Be sure nobody hears of this”. 
But they had no sooner gone out than they talked of him in all the country round.
</p>

<h4>Cure of a dumb demoniac (9:32–34)</h4>

<p>
And it chanced that, as they were going, a dumb man was brought to him, possessed with a devil. 
The devil was cast out, and the dumb man found speech; at which the multitudes were filled with amazement; “Nothing like this”, they said, “was ever seen in Israel”. 
</p>

<p>
But the Pharisees said, “It is the prince of the devils that enables him to cast the devils out”.
</p>

<h4>The distress of the crowds (9:35–37)</h4>

<p>
So Jesus went about all their cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and infirmity.
</p>

<p>
Yet still, when he looked at the multitudes, he was moved with pity for them, seeing them harried and abject, like sheep that have no shepherd. 
Thereupon he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful enough, but the labourers are few; 
you must ask the Lord to whom the harvest belongs to send labourers out for the harvesting”.
</p>
