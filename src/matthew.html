<h2>I. The Birth and Infancy of Jesus</h2>

<h4>The ancestry of Jesus (1:1–17)</h4>

A record of the ancestry from which Jesus Christ, the son of David, son of Abraham, was born.

<blockquote>
Abraham was the father of Isaac, <br />
Isaac of Jacob, <br />
Jacob of Juda and his brethren; <br />
Juda of Phares and Zara, by Thamar; <br />
Phares of Esron, <br />
Esron of Aram, <br />
Aram of Aminadab, <br />
Aminadab of Naasson, <br />
Naasson of Salmon; <br />
Salmon of Booz, by Rahab; <br />
Booz of Obed, by Ruth; <br />
Obed of Jesse; <br />
and Jesse was the father of king David. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
And king David was the father of Solomon, by her that had been the wife of Urias. <br />
Solomon was the father of Roboam, <br />
Roboam of Abias, <br />
Abias of Asa, <br />
Asa of Josaphat, <br />
Josaphat of Joram, <br />
Joram of Ozias, <br />
Ozias of Joatham, <br />
Joatham of Achaz, <br />
Achaz of Ezechias, <br />
Ezechias of Manasses, <br />
Manasses of Amon, <br />
Amon of Josias; <br />
and Josias was the father of Jechonias and his brethren, <br />
at the time of the removal to Babylon.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
And after the removal to Babylon, <br />
Jechonias was the father of Salathiel, <br />
Salathiel of Zorobabel, <br />
Zorobabel of Abiud, <br />
Abiud of Eliacim, <br />
Eliacim of Azor, <br />
Azor of Sadoc, <br />
Sadoc of Achim, <br />
Achim of Eliud, <br />
Eliud of Eleazar, <br />
Eleazar of Mathan, <br />
Mathan of Jacob, <br />
and Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary; <br />
it was of her that Jesus was born, who is called Christ.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">[1]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus there are fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the captivity in Babylon, and fourteen from the captivity in Babylon to Christ.
</p>


<h4>The virginal conception of Christ (1:18–25)</h4>

<p>
And this was the manner of Christ’s birth. 
His mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, but they had not yet come together, when she was found to be with child, by the power of the Holy Ghost. 
Whereupon her husband Joseph (for he was a right-minded man, and would not have her put to open shame) was for sending her away in secret. 
But hardly had this thought come to his mind, when an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take your wife Mary to yourself, for it is by the power of the Holy Ghost that she has conceived this child; and she will bear a son, whom you shall call Jesus, for he is to save his people from their sins.” 
All this was so ordained to fulfil the word which the Lord spoke by his prophet:
</p>

<blockquote>
Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son, <br />
and they shall call him Emmanuel.
</blockquote>

<p>(which means, God with us.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">[2]</a>) 
And Joseph awoke from sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, taking his wife to himself; and he had not known her when she bore a son, her first-born, to whom he gave the name Jesus.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">[3]</a>
</p>

<h4>The visit of the Magi (2:1–12)</h4>

<p>
Jesus was born at Bethlehem, in Juda, in the days of king Herod. 
And thereupon certain wise men came out of the east to Jerusalem, who asked, “Where is he that has been born, the king of the Jews? We have seen his star out in the east, and we have come to worship him”. 
King Herod was troubled when he heard it, and all Jerusalem with him; so that he assembled all the chief priests and learned men among the people, and enquired of them where it was that Christ would be born. 
And they told him, At Bethlehem in Juda; so it has been written by the prophet:
</p>

<blockquote>
And you, Bethlehem, of the land of Juda, <br />are far from the least among the princes of Juda, <br />
for out of you will arise a leader <br />
who is to be the shepherd of my people Israel.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">[4]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Then, summoning the wise men in secret, Herod questioned them closely upon the time of the star’s appearing. 
And he sent them on their way to Bethlehem, saying to them, “Go and enquire carefully for the child, and when you have found him, bring me back word, so that I too may come and worship him”. 
They obeyed the king, and went on their journey; and all at once the star which they had seen in the east was there going before them, until at last it stood still over the place where the child was. 
They, when they saw the star, were glad beyond measure; and so, going into the dwelling, they found the child there, with his mother Mary, and fell down to worship him; and, opening their store of treasures, they offered him gifts, of gold and frankincense and myrrh. 
Afterwards, because they had received a warning in a dream forbidding them to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by a different way. 
</p>

<h4>The flight into Egypt. The massacre of the Innocents (2:13–18)</h4>

<p>
As soon as they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and said, “Rise up, take with you the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt; there remain, until I give you word. For Herod will soon be making search for the child, to destroy him”. 
He rose up, therefore, while it was still night, and took the child and his mother with him, and withdrew into Egypt, where he remained until the death of Herod, in fulfilment of the word which the Lord spoke by his prophet, 
</p>

<blockquote>
I called my son out of Egypt.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">[5]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Meanwhile, when he found that the wise men had played him false, Herod was angry beyond measure; he sent and made away with all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its neighbourhood, of two years old and less, reckoning the time by the careful enquiry which he had made of the wise men. 
It was then that the word spoken by the prophet Jeremy was fulfilled: 
</p>

<blockquote>
A voice was heard in Rama, <br />
lamentation and great mourning; <br />
it was Rachel weeping for her children, <br />
and she would not be comforted, <br />
because none is left.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">[6]</a>
</blockquote>

<h4>From Egypt to Nazareth (2:19–23)</h4>

<p>But as soon as Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in Egypt in a dream, and said: “Rise up, take with you the child and his mother, and return to the land of Israel; for those who sought the child’s life are dead”. 
So he arose, and took the child and his mother with him, and came into the land of Israel. 
But, when he heard that Archelaus was king in Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to return there; and so, receiving a warning in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee; where he came to live in a town called Nazareth, in fulfilment of what was said by the prophets, 
</p>

<blockquote>
He shall be called a Nazarene.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">[7]</a>
</blockquote>

<h2>II The Kingdom of Heaven Proclaimed</h2>

<h3>A. Narrative Section</h3>

<h4>The preaching of John the Baptist (3:1–12)</h4>

<p>
In those days John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea; 
“Repent”, he said, “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”. 
It was of him that the prophet Isaias spoke, when he said,
</p>

<blockquote>
There is a voice of one crying in the wilderness, <br />
Prepare the way of the Lord, <br />
straighten out his paths.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">[8]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
And he, John, wore a garment of camel’s hair, and a leather girdle about his loins, and locusts and wild honey were his food. 
Thereupon Jerusalem and all Judaea, and all those who dwelt round Jordan, went out to see him, and he baptized them in the Jordan, while they confessed their sins. 
Many of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees came to his baptizing; and when he saw these, he asked them, “Who was it that taught you, brood of vipers, to flee from the vengeance that draws near? 
Come, then, yield the acceptable fruit of repentance; 
do not presume to say in your hearts, ‘We have Abraham for our father’; 
I tell you, God has power to raise up children to Abraham out of these very stones. 
Already the axe has been put to the root of the trees, so that every tree which does not show good fruit will be hewn down and cast into the fire. 
As for me, I am baptizing you with water, for your repentance; 
but one is to come after me who is mightier than I, so that I am not worthy even to carry his shoes for him; 
he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">[9]</a> 
He holds his winnowing-fan ready, to sweep his threshing-floor clean; 
he will gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will consume with fire that can never be quenched.
</p>

<h4>Jesus is baptised (3:13–17)</h4>

<p>
Then Jesus came from Galilee and stood before John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him. 
John would have restrained him; 
“It is I”, he said, “that ought to be baptized by you, and do you come to me instead?”.
</p> 

<p>
But Jesus answered, “Let it be so for the present; 
it is well that we should thus fulfil all due observance”. 
Then John gave way to him. 
So Jesus was baptized, and as he came straight up out of the water, suddenly heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and resting upon him. 
</p>

<p>
And with that, a voice came from heaven, which said, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”. 
</p>

<h4>Temptation in the wilderness (4:1–11)</h4>

<p>
And now Jesus was led by the Spirit away into the wilderness, to be tempted there by the devil. 
Forty days and forty nights he spent fasting, and at the end of them was hungry. 
Then the tempter approached, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, bid these stones turn into loaves of bread”.
</p>

<p>
He answered, ”It is written, 
</p>

<blockquote>
Man cannot live by bread only; <br />
there is life for him in all the words which proceed from the mouth of God.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">[10]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Next, the devil took him into the holy city, and there set him down on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, “If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down to earth; 
for it is written, 
</p>

<blockquote>
He has given charge to his angels concerning you, <br />
and they will hold you up with their hands, <br />
lest you should chance to trip on a stone”.
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus said to him, ”But it is further written, 
</p>

<blockquote>
You shall not put the Lord your God to the proof”.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">[11]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Once more, the devil took him to the top of an exceedingly high mountain, from which he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, and said, “I will give you all these if you will fall down and worship me.
</p>

<p>
Then Jesus said to him, “Away with thee, Satan; it is written, 
</p>

<blockquote>
You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve none but him”.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">[12]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Then the devil left him alone; 
and thereupon angels came and ministered to him.
</p>

<h4>Return to Galilee (4:12–17)</h4>

<p>
After this, hearing of John’s imprisonment, he withdrew into Galilee. 
And now, forsaking the city of Nazareth, he came and settled down in Capharnaum, which is by the sea-shore, in the country of Zabulon and Nephthalim, in fulfilment of what was said by the prophet Isaias:
</p>

<blockquote>
The land of Zabulon and Nephthalim, <br />
on the sea road, beyond Jordan, <br />the Galilee of the Gentiles!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">[13]</a> <br />
The people that abode in darkness <br />
has seen a great light; <br />
for men abiding in a land where death overshadowed them, <br />
light has dawned.
</blockquote>

<p>
From that time onwards, Jesus began to preach; 
“Repent”, he said, “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”.
</p>

<h4>The first four disciples are called (4:18–22)</h4>

<p>
And as he walked by the sea of Galilee, Jesus saw two brethren, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen); 
and he said to them, “Come and follow me; I will make you into fishers of men”. 
And they dropped their nets immediately, and followed him. 
Then he went further on, and saw two others that were brethren, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John; 
they were in the boat with their father Zebedee, repairing their nets, and he called them to him; 
whereupon they dropped the nets and left their father immediately, and followed him.
</p>

<h4>Jesus preaches and heals the sick (4:23–25)</h4>

<p>
So Jesus went about the whole of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and infirmity among the people; 
so that his fame spread throughout the whole of Syria, and they brought to him all those who were in affliction, distressed with pain and sickness of every sort, the possessed, the lunatics, the palsied; 
and he healed them.
And a great multitude followed him, from Galilee and Decapolis, Jerusalem and Judaea, and the country beyond Jordan.
