<h2>I: The Birth and Infancy of Jesus</h2>

<h4>The ancestry of Jesus (1:1–17)</h4>

Roll of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham:

<blockquote>
Abraham fathered Isaac, <br />
Isaac fathered Jacob, <br />
Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers, <br />
Judah fathered Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, <br />
Perez fathered Hezron, <br />
Hezron fathered Ram, <br />
Ram fathered Amminadab, 
Amminadab fathered Nahshon, <br />
Nahshon fathered Salmon, <br />
Salmon fathered Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, <br />
Boaz fathered Obed, whose mother was Ruth, <br />
Obed fathered Jesse; <br />
and Jesse fathered King David.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
David fathered Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife, <br />
Solomon fathered Rehoboam, <br />
Rehoboam fathered Abijah, <br />
Abijah fathered Asa, <br />
Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, <br />
Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, <br />
Joram fathered Uzziah, <br />
Uzziah fathered Jotham, <br />
Jotham fathered Ahaz, <br />
Ahaz fathered Hezekiah, <br />
Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, <br />
Manasseh fathered Amon, <br />
Amon fathered Josiah; <br />
and Josiah fathered Jechoniah and his brothers. <br />
Then the deportation to Babylon took place.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
After the deportation to Babylon: <br />
Jechoniah fathered Shealtiel, <br />
Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel, <br />
Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, <br />
Abiud fathered Eliakim, <br />
Eliakim fathered Azor, <br />
Azor fathered Zadok, <br />
Zadok fathered Achim, <br />
Achim fathered Eliud, <br />
Eliud fathered Eleazar, <br />
Eleazar fathered Matthan, <br />
Matthan fathered Jacob; <br />
and Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Mary; <br />
of her was born Jesus who is called Christ.
</blockquote>

<p>
The sum of generations is therefore: fourteen from Abraham to David; fourteen from David to the Babylonian deportation; and fourteen from the Babylonian deportation to Christ.
</p>


<h4>Joseph adopts Jesus as his son (1:18–25)</h4>

<p>
This is how Jesus Christ came to be born. His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph; but before they came to live together she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. 
Her husband Joseph, being an upright man and wanting to spare her disgrace, decided to divorce her informally. 
He had made up his mind to do this when suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because she has conceived what is in her by the Holy Spirit. 
She will give birth to a son and you must name him Jesus, because he is the one who is to save his people from their sins”. 
Now all this took place to fulfil what the Lord had spoken through the prophet:
</p>

<blockquote>
Look! the virgin is with child and will give birth to a son <br />
whom they will call Immanuel, 
</blockquote>

<p>
a name which means 'God-is-with-us'. 
When Joseph woke up he did what the angel of the Lord had told him to do: he took his wife to his home; 
he had not had intercourse with her when she gave birth to a son; and he named him Jesus.
</p>

<h4>The visit of the Magi (2:1–12)</h4>

<p>
After Jesus had been born at Bethlehem in Judaea during the reign of King Herod, suddenly some wise men came to Jerusalem from the east 
asking, “Where is the infant king of the Jews? We saw his star as it rose and have come to do him homage”. 
When King Herod heard this he was perturbed, and so was the whole of Jerusalem. 
He called together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and enquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
</p>

<p>
They told him, “At Bethlehem in Judaea, for this is what the prophet wrote:
</p>

<blockquote>
And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, <br />
you are by no means the least among the leaders of Judah, <br />
for from you will come a leader <br />
who will shepherd my people Israel”.
</blockquote>

<p>
Then Herod summoned the wise men to see him privately. He asked them the exact date on which the star had appeared 
and sent them on to Bethlehem with the words, “Go and find out all about the child, and when you have found him, let me know, so that I too may go and do him homage”. 
Having listened to what the king had to say, they set out. And suddenly the star they had seen rising went forward and halted over the place where the child was. 
The sight of the star filled them with delight, 
and going into the house they saw the child with his mother Mary, and falling to their knees they did him homage. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh. 
But they were given a warning in a dream not to go back to Herod, and returned to their own country by a different way.
</p>

<h4>The flight into Egypt. The massacre of the Innocents (2:13–18)</h4>

<p>
After they had left, suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother with you, and escape into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search for the child and do away with him”. 
So Joseph got up and, taking the child and his mother with him, left that night for Egypt, 
where he stayed until Herod was dead. This was to fulfil what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: 
</p>

<blockquote>
I called my son out of Egypt. 
</blockquote>

<p>
Herod was furious on realising that he had been fooled by the wise men, and in Bethlehem and its surrounding district he had all the male children killed who were two years old or less, reckoning by the date he had been careful to ask the wise men. 
Then were fulfilled the words spoken through the prophet Jeremiah: 
</p>

<blockquote>
A voice is heard in Ramah, <br />
lamenting and weeping bitterly: <br />
it is Rachel weeping for her children, <br />
refusing to be comforted <br />
because they are no more.
</blockquote>

<h4>From Egypt to Nazareth (2:19–23)</h4>

<p>
After Herod's death, suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt 
and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother with you and go back to the land of Israel, for those who wanted to kill the child are dead”.
So Joseph got up and, taking the child and his mother with him, went back to the land of Israel. 
But when he learnt that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as ruler of Judaea he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the region of Galilee. 
There he settled in a town called Nazareth. In this way the words spoken through the prophets were to be fulfilled: 
</p>

<blockquote>
He will be called a Nazarene. 
</blockquote>

<h2>II: The Kingdom of Heaven Announced</h2>

<h3>A: Narrative Section</h3>

<h4>The proclamation of John the Baptist (3:1–12)</h4>

<p>
In due course John the Baptist appeared; he proclaimed this message in the desert of Judaea, 
“Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven is close at hand”. 
This was the man spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said: 
</p>

<blockquote>
A voice of one that cries in the desert, <br />
“Prepare a way for the Lord, <br />
make his paths straight”. 
</blockquote>

<p>
This man John wore a garment made of camel-hair with a leather loin-cloth round his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. 
Then Jerusalem and all Judaea and the whole Jordan district made their way to him, 
and as they were baptised by him in the river Jordan they confessed their sins. 
But when he saw a number of Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism he said to them, “Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming retribution? 
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance, 
and do not presume to tell yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father’, because, I tell you, God can raise children for Abraham from these stones. 
Even now the axe is being laid to the root of the trees, so that any tree failing to produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown on the fire. 
I baptise you in water for repentance, but the one who comes after me is more powerful than I, and I am not fit to carry his sandals; he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 
His winnowing-fan is in his hand; he will clear his threshing-floor and gather his wheat into his barn; but the chaff he will burn in a fire that will never go out”. 
</p>

<h4>Jesus is baptised (3:13–17)</h4>

<p>
Then Jesus appeared: he came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptised by John. 
John tried to dissuade him, with the words, “It is I who need baptism from you, and yet you come to me!”.
</p>

<p>
But Jesus replied, “Leave it like this for the time being; it is fitting that we should, in this way, do all that uprightness demands”. Then John gave in to him.
</p> 

<p>
And when Jesus had been baptised he at once came up from the water, and suddenly the heavens opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming down on him. 
And suddenly there was a voice from heaven, “This is my Son, the Beloved; my favour rests on him”. 
</p>

<h4>Testing in the desert (4:1–11)</h4>

<p>
Then Jesus was led by the Spirit out into the desert to be put to the test by the devil. 
He fasted for forty days and forty nights, after which he was hungry, 
and the tester came and said to him, “If you are Son of God, tell these stones to turn into loaves”. 
</p>

<p>
But he replied, “Scripture says: 
</p>

<blockquote>
Human beings live not on bread alone <br />
but on every word that comes from the mouth of God”.
</blockquote>

<p>
The devil then took him to the holy city and set him on the parapet of the Temple. 
“If you are Son of God”, he said, ”throw yourself down; for scripture says:
</p>

<blockquote>
He has given his angels orders about you, <br />
and they will carry you in their arms <br />
in case you trip over a stone”.
</blockquote>

<p>
Jesus said to him, “Scripture also says:
</p>

<blockquote>
Do not put the Lord your God to the test”.
</blockquote>

<p>
Next, taking him to a very high mountain, the devil showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour. 
And he said to him, “I will give you all these, if you fall at my feet and do me homage”. 
</p>

<p>
Then Jesus replied, “Away with you, Satan! For scripture says: 
</p>

<blockquote>
The Lord your God is the one to whom you must do homage, <br />
him alone you must serve”.
</blockquote>

<p>
Then the devil left him, and suddenly angels appeared and looked after him.
</p>

<h4>Return to Galilee (4:12–17)</h4>

<p>
Hearing that John had been arrested he withdrew to Galilee, 
and leaving Nazara he went and settled in Capernaum, beside the lake, on the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali. 
This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
</p>

<blockquote>
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! <br />
Way of the sea beyond Jordan. <br />
Galilee of the nations! <br />
The people that lived in darkness <br />
have seen a great light; <br />
on those who lived in a country of shadow dark as death <br />
a light has dawned.
</blockquote>

<p>
From then onwards Jesus began his proclamation with the message, “Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven is close at hand”.
</p>

<h4>The first four disciples are called (4:18–22)</h4>

<p>
As he was walking by the Lake of Galilee he saw two brothers, Simon, who was called Peter, and his brother Andrew; they were making a cast into the lake with their net, for they were fishermen. 
And he said to them, “Come after me and I will make you fishers of people”. 
And at once they left their nets and followed him. 
</p>

<p>
Going on from there he saw another pair of brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John; they were in their boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them. 
And at once, leaving the boat and their father, they followed him.
</p>

<h4>Jesus proclaims the message and heals the sick (4:23–25)</h4>

<p>
He went round the whole of Galilee teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing all kinds of disease and illness among the people. 
His fame spread throughout Syria, and those who were suffering from diseases and painful complaints of one kind or another, the possessed, epileptics, the paralysed, were all brought to him, and he cured them. 
Large crowds followed him, coming from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judaea and Transjordan.
</p>

<h3>B: The Sermon on the Mount</h3>

<h4>The Beatitudes (5:1–12)</h4>

<p>
Seeing the crowds, he went onto the mountain. And when he was seated his disciples came to him. 
Then he began to speak. This is what he taught them:
</p>

<blockquote>
How blessed are the poor in spirit: <br />
the kingdom of Heaven is theirs.
Blessed are the gentle: <br />
they shall have the earth as inheritance. <br />
Blessed are those who mourn: <br />
they shall be comforted. <br />
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for uprightness: <br />
they shall have their fill. <br />
Blessed are the merciful: <br />
they shall have mercy shown them. <br />
Blessed are the pure in heart: <br />
they shall see God. <br />
Blessed are the peacemakers: <br />
they shall be recognised as children of God. <br />
Blessed are those who are persecuted in the cause of uprightness: <br />
the kingdom of Heaven is theirs.
</blockquote>

<p>
“Blessed are you when people abuse you and persecute you and speak all kinds of calumny against you falsely on my account. 
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven; this is how they persecuted the prophets before you.
</p>

<h4>Salt for the earth and light for the world (5:13–16)</h4>

<p>
“You are salt for the earth. But if salt loses its taste, what can make it salty again? It is good for nothing, and can only be thrown out to be trampled under people’s feet. 
</p>

<p>
“You are light for the world. A city built on a hill-top cannot be hidden. 
No one lights a lamp to put it under a tub; they put it on the lamp-stand where it shines for everyone in the house. 
In the same way your light must shine in people’s sight, so that, seeing your good works, they may give praise to your Father in heaven. 
</p>

<h4>The fulfilment of the Law (5:17–19)</h4>

<p>
“Do not imagine that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have come not to abolish but to complete them. 
In truth I tell you, till heaven and earth disappear, not one dot, not one little stroke, is to disappear from the Law until all its purpose is achieved. 
Therefore, anyone who infringes even one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be considered the least in the kingdom of Heaven; but the person who keeps them and teaches them will be considered great in the kingdom of Heaven.
</p>

<h4>The new standard higher than the old (5:20–48)</h4>

<p>
“For I tell you, if your uprightness does not surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never get into the kingdom of Heaven. 
</p>

<p>
“You have heard how it was said to our ancestors:, ‘You shall not kill; and if anyone does kill he must answer for it before the court’. 
But I say this to you: anyone who is angry with a brother will answer for it before the court; anyone who calls a brother ‘Fool’ will answer for it before the Sanhedrin; and anyone who calls him ‘Traitor’ will answer for it in hell fire. 
So then, if you are bringing your offering to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, 
leave your offering there before the altar, go and be reconciled with your brother first, and then come back and present your offering. 
Come to terms with your opponent in good time while you are still on the way to the court with him, or he may hand you over to the judge and the judge to the officer, and you will be thrown into prison. 
In truth I tell you, you will not get out till you have paid the last penny. 
</p>

<p>
“You have heard how it was said: ‘You shall not commit adultery’. 
But I say this to you: if a man looks at a woman lustfully, he has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 
If your right eye should be your downfall, tear it out and throw it away; for it will do you less harm to lose one part of yourself than to have your whole body thrown into hell. 
And if your right hand should be your downfall, cut it off and throw it away; for it will do you less harm to lose one part of yourself than to have your whole body go to hell. 
</p>

<p>
“It has also been said: ‘Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a writ of dismissal’. 
But I say this to you: everyone who divorces his wife, except for the case of an illicit marriage, makes her an adulteress; and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. 
</p>

<p>
“Again, you have heard how it was said to our ancestors: ‘You must not break your oath, but must fulfil your oaths to the Lord’. 
But I say this to you: do not swear at all, either by heaven, since that is God’s throne; 
or by earth, since that is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, since that is the city of the great King. 
Do not swear by your own head either, since you cannot turn a single hair white or black. 
All you need say is ‘Yes’ if you mean yes, ‘No’ if you mean no; anything more than this comes from the Evil One.
</p>

<p>
“You have heard how it was said: ‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth’. 
But I say this to you: offer no resistance to the wicked. On the contrary, if anyone hits you on the right cheek, offer him the other as well; 
if someone wishes to go to law with you to get your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. 
And if anyone requires you to go one mile, go two miles with him. 
Give to anyone who asks you, and if anyone wants to borrow, do not turn away.
</p>

<p>
“You have heard how it was said: ‘You will love your neighbour and hate your enemy’. 
But I say this to you: love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you; 
so that you may be children of your Father in heaven, for he causes his sun to rise on the bad as well as the good, and sends down rain to fall on the upright and the wicked alike. 
For if you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Do not even the tax collectors do as much? 
And if you save your greetings for your brothers, are you doing anything exceptional? 
Do not even the gentiles do as much? You must therefore set no bounds to your love, just as your heavenly Father sets none to his. 
</p>

<h4>Almsgiving in secret (6:1–4)</h4>

<p>
“Be careful not to parade your uprightness in public to attract attention; otherwise you will lose all reward from your Father in heaven. 
So when you give alms, do not have it trumpeted before you; this is what the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets to win human admiration. In truth I tell you, they have had their reward. 
But when you give alms, your left hand must not know what your right is doing; 
your almsgiving must be secret, and your Father who sees all that is done in secret will reward you. 
</p>

<h4>Prayer in secret (6:5–6)</h4>

<p>
“And when you pray, do not imitate the hypocrites: they love to say their prayers standing up in the synagogues and at the street corners for people to see them. In truth I tell you, they have had their reward. 
But when you pray, go to your private room, shut yourself in, and so pray to your Father who is in that secret place, and your Father who sees all that is done in secret will reward you. 
</p>

<h4>How to pray. The Lord’s Prayer (6:7–15)</h4>

<p>
“In your prayers do not babble as the gentiles do, for they think that by using many words they will make themselves heard. 
Do not be like them; your Father knows what you need before you ask him. 
So you should pray like this: 
</p>

<blockquote>
Our Father in heaven, <br />
may your name be held holy, <br />
your kingdom come, <br />
your will be done, <br />
on earth as in heaven.
Give us today our <s>daily</s> supersubstantial bread. <br />
And forgive us our debts, <br />
as we have forgiven those who are in debt to us. <br />
And do not put us to the test, <br />
but save us from the Evil One.
</blockquote>

<p>
”Yes, if you forgive others their failings, your heavenly Father will forgive you yours; 
but if you do not forgive others, your Father will not forgive your failings either.
</p>

<h4>Fasting in secret (6:16–18)</h4>

<p>
“When you are fasting, do not put on a gloomy look as the hypocrites do: they go about looking unsightly to let people know they are fasting. In truth I tell you, they have had their reward. 
But when you fast, put scent on your head and wash your face, 
so that no one will know you are fasting except your Father who sees all that is done in secret; and your Father who sees all that is done in secret will reward you.
</p>

<h4>True treasures (6:19–21)</h4>

<p>
“Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moth and woodworm destroy them and thieves can break in and steal. 
But store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where neither moth nor woodworm destroys them and thieves cannot break in and steal. 
For wherever your treasure is, there will your heart be too.
</p>

<h4>The eye, the lamp of the body (6:22–23)</h4>

<p>
“The lamp of the body is the eye. It follows that if your eye is clear, your whole body will be filled with light. 
But if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be darkness. If then, the light inside you is darkened, what darkness that will be! 
</p>

<h4>God and money (6:24)</h4>

<p>
“No one can be the slave of two masters: he will either hate the first and love the second, or be attached to the first and despise the second. You cannot be the slave both of God and of money.
</p>

<h4>Trust in Providence (6:25–34)</h4>

<p>
“That is why I am telling you not to worry about your life and what you are to eat, nor about your body and what you are to wear. Surely life is more than food, and the body more than clothing! 
Look at the birds in the sky. They do not sow or reap or gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they are? 
Can any of you, however much you worry, add one single cubit to your span of life? 
And why worry about clothing? Think of the flowers growing in the fields; they never have to work or spin; 
yet I assure you that not even Solomon in all his royal robes was clothed like one of these. 
Now if that is how God clothes the wild flowers growing in the field which are there today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow, will he not much more look after you, you who have so little faith? 
So do not worry; do not say, ‘What are we to eat? What are we to drink? What are we to wear?’. 
It is the gentiles who set their hearts on all these things. Your heavenly Father knows you need them all. 
Set your hearts on his kingdom first, and on God’s saving justice, and all these other things will be given you as well. 
So do not worry about tomorrow: tomorrow will take care of itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
</p>

<h4>Do not judge (7:1–5)</h4>

<p>
“Do not judge, and you will not be judged; 
because the judgements you give are the judgements you will get, and the standard you use will be the standard used for you. 
Why do you observe the splinter in your brother’s eye and never notice the great log in your own? 
And how dare you say to your brother, ‘Let me take that splinter out of your eye’, when, look, there is a great log in your own? 
Hypocrite! Take the log out of your own eye first, and then you will see clearly enough to take the splinter out of your brother’s eye.
</p>

<h4>Do not profane sacred things (7:6)</h4>

<p>
“Do not give dogs what is holy; and do not throw your pearls in front of pigs, or they may trample them and then turn on you and tear you to pieces.
</p>

<h4>Effective prayer (7:7–11)</h4>

<p>
“Ask, and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. 
Everyone who asks receives; everyone who searches finds; everyone who knocks will have the door opened. 
Is there anyone among you who would hand his son a stone when he asked for bread? 
Or would hand him a snake when he asked for a fish? 
If you, then, evil as you are, know how to give your children what is good, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
</p>

<h4>The golden rule (7:12)</h4>

<p>
“So always treat others as you would like them to treat you; that is the Law and the Prophets.
</p>

<h4>The two ways (7:13–14)</h4>

<p>
“Enter by the narrow gate, since the road that leads to destruction is wide and spacious, and many take it; 
but it is a narrow gate and a hard road that leads to life, and only a few find it.
</p>

<h4>False prophets (7:15–20)</h4>

<p>
“Beware of false prophets who come to you disguised as sheep but underneath are ravenous wolves. 
You will be able to tell them by their fruits. Can people pick grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? 
In the same way, a sound tree produces good fruit but a rotten tree bad fruit. 
A sound tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor a rotten tree bear good fruit. 
Any tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown on the fire. 
I repeat, you will be able to tell them by their fruits.
</p>

<h4>The true disciple (7:21–27)</h4>

<p>
“It is not anyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord’, who will enter the kingdom of Heaven, but the person who does the will of my Father in heaven. 
When the day comes many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, drive out demons in your name, work many miracles in your name?’. 
Then I shall tell them to their faces: I have never known you; away from me, all evil doers! 
</p>

<p>
Therefore, everyone who listens to these words of mine and acts on them will be like a sensible man who built his house on rock. 
Rain came down, floods rose, gales blew and hurled themselves against that house, and it did not fall: it was founded on rock. 
But everyone who listens to these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a stupid man who built his house on sand. 
Rain came down, floods rose, gales blew and struck that house, and it fell; and what a fall it had!”.
</p>

<h4>The amazement of the crowds (7:28–29)</h4>

<p>
Jesus had now finished what he wanted to say, and his teaching made a deep impression on the people 
because he taught them with authority, unlike their own scribes.
</p>

<h2>III: The Kingdom of Heaven is Preached</h2>

<h3>A: Narrative Section: Ten Miracles</h3>

<h4>Cure of a man with skin-disease (8:1–4)</h4>

<p>
After he had come down from the mountain large crowds followed him. 
Suddenly a man with a virulent skin-disease came up and bowed low in front of him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you can cleanse me”. 
</p>

<p>
Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him saying, “I am willing. Be cleansed”. And his skin-disease was cleansed at once. 
Then Jesus said to him, “Mind you tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest and make the offering prescribed by Moses, as evidence to them”. 
</p>

<h4>Cure of the centurion’s servant (8:5–13)</h4>

<p>
When he went into Capernaum a centurion came up and pleaded with him. 
“Sir”, he said, “my servant is lying at home paralysed and in great pain”. 
</p>

<p>
Jesus said to him, “I will come myself and cure him”. 
</p>

<p>
The centurion replied, “Sir, I am not worthy to have you under my roof; just give the word and my servant will be cured. 
For I am under authority myself and have soldiers under me; and I say to one man, ‘Go’, and he goes; to another, ‘Come here’, and he comes; to my servant, ‘Do this’, and he does it”. 
</p>

<p>
When Jesus heard this he was astonished and said to those following him, “In truth I tell you, in no one in Israel have I found faith as great as this. 
And I tell you that many will come from east and west and sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob at the feast in the kingdom of Heaven; 
but the children of the kingdom will be thrown out into the darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth”.
And to the centurion Jesus said, “Go back, then; let this be done for you, as your faith demands”. And the servant was cured at that moment.
</p>

<h4>Cure of Peter’s mother-in-law (8:14–15)</h4>

<p>
And going into Peter’s house Jesus found Peter’s mother-in-law in bed and feverish. 
He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve him.
</p>

<h4>A number of cures (8:16–17)</h4>

<p>
That evening they brought him many who were possessed by devils. He drove out the spirits with a command and cured all who were sick. 
This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: 
</p> 

<blockquote>
He himself bore our sicknesses away and carried our diseases.

<h4>Unconditional commitment (8:18–22)</h4>

<p>
When Jesus saw the crowd all about him he gave orders to leave for the other side. 
One of the scribes then came up and said to him, “Master, I will follow you wherever you go”.
</p>

<p>
Jesus said, “Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head”.
</p>

<p>
Another man, one of the disciples, said to him, “Lord, let me go and bury my father first”.
</p>

<p>
But Jesus said, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their dead”. 
</p>

<h4>The calming of the storm (8:23–27)</h4>

<p>
Then he got into the boat followed by his disciples. 
Suddenly a storm broke over the lake, so violent that the boat was being swamped by the waves. But he was asleep. 
So they went to him and woke him saying, “Save us, Lord, we are lost!”.
</p>

<p>
And he said to them, “Why are you so frightened, you who have so little faith?”. And then he stood up and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. 
</p>

<p>
They were astounded and said, “Whatever kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?”.
</p>

<h4>The demoniacs of Gadara (8:28–34)</h4>

<p>
When he reached the territory of the Gadarenes on the other side, two demoniacs came towards him out of the tombs — they were so dangerously violent that nobody could use that path. 
Suddenly they shouted, “What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torture us before the time?”. 
Now some distance away there was a large herd of pigs feeding, 
and the devils pleaded with Jesus, “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs”.
</p>

<p>
And he said to them, “Go then”, and they came out and made for the pigs; and at that the whole herd charged down the cliff into the lake and perished in the water. 
The herdsmen ran off and made for the city, where they told the whole story, including what had happened to the demoniacs. 
Suddenly the whole city set out to meet Jesus; and as soon as they saw him they implored him to leave their neighbourhood.
</p>

<h4>Cure of a paralytic (9:1–8)</h4>
HERE
<p>
So he took ship across the sea, and came to his own city. 
And now they brought before him a man who was palsied and bed-ridden; whereupon Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the palsied man, “Son, take courage, your sins are forgiven”.
</p>

<p>
And at this, some of the scribes said to themselves, “He is talking blasphemously”. 
</p>

<p>
Jesus read their minds, and said, “Why do you cherish wicked thoughts in your hearts? 
Tell me, which command is more lightly given, to say to a man, ‘Your sins are forgiven’, or to say, ‘Rise up, and walk’?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-26" id="noteref-26" epub:type="noteref">[26]</a> 
And now, to convince you that the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins while he is on earth” (here he spoke to the palsied man), “Rise up, take your bed with you, and go home”. 
And he rose up, and went back to his house, 
so that the multitudes were filled with awe at seeing it, and praised God for giving such powers to men.
</p>

<h4>The call of Matthew (9:9)</h4>

<p>
As he passed further on his way, Jesus saw a man called Matthew sitting at work in the customs-house, and said to him, “Follow me”; and Matthew rose from his place and followed him.
</p>

<h4>Eating with sinners (9:10–13)</h4>

<p>
And afterwards, when he was taking a meal in the house, many publicans and sinners were to be found at table with him and his disciples. 
The Pharisees saw this, and asked his disciples, “How comes it that your master eats with publicans and sinners?”.
</p>

<p>
Jesus heard it, and said, “It is not those who are in health that have need of the physician, it is those who are sick. 
Go home and find out what the words mean, ‘It is mercy that wins favour with me, not sacrifice’. I have come to call sinners, not the just”.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-27" id="noteref-27" epub:type="noteref">[27]</a>
</p>

<h4>A discussion on fasting (9:14–17)</h4>

<p>
Then John’s disciples came to him, and asked, “How is it that your disciples do not fast, when we and the Pharisees fast so often?”.</p>

<p>
To them Jesus said, “Can you expect the men of the bridegroom’s company to go mourning, while the bridegroom is still with them? No, the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them; then they will fast. 
Nobody uses a piece of new cloth to patch an old cloak; that would take away from the cloak all its pattern, and make the rent in it worse than before.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-28" id="noteref-28" epub:type="noteref">[28]</a> 
Nor is new wine put into old wine-skins; if that is done, the skins burst, and there is the wine spilt and the skins spoiled. If the wine is new, it is put into fresh wine-skins, and so both are kept safe.”
</p>

<h4>Cure of the woman with a haemorrhage. The official’s daughter raised to life (9:18–26)</h4>

<p>
While he thus spoke to them, it chanced that one of the rulers came and knelt before him, and said, “Lord, my daughter is this moment dead; come now and lay your hand on her, and she will live”. 
So Jesus rose up and went after him, and so did his disciples.
</p>

<p>
And now a woman who for twelve years had been troubled with an issue of blood, came up behind him and touched the hem of his cloak; 
she said to herself, “If I can even touch the hem of his cloak, I shall be healed”.
</p>

<p>
Jesus turned and caught sight of her; and he said, “Have no fear, my daughter, your faith has brought you healing”. And the woman recovered her health from that hour.
</p>

<p>
So Jesus came into the ruler’s house, where he found mourners playing the flute, and the multitude thronging noisily; 
and he said, “Make room there; the child is not dead, she is asleep”; and they laughed aloud at him. 
But when the multitude had been turned away, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she rose up. 
And the story of these doings spread abroad through all the country round.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-29" id="noteref-29" epub:type="noteref">[29]</a>
</p>

<h4>Cure of two blind men (9:27–31)</h4>

<p>
As Jesus was passing further on his way, he was followed by two blind men, who cried aloud, “Son of David, have pity on us”. 
</p>

<p>
These blind men came to him when he had gone into his lodging, and Jesus said to them, “Have you the faith to believe that I can do this?”. 
</p>

<p>
And they said to him, ”Yes, Lord”. 
</p>

<p>
Thereupon, he touched their eyes, and said, “Your faith shall not be disappointed”. 
Then their eyes were opened; and Jesus laid a strict charge on them, telling them, “Be sure nobody hears of this”. 
But they had no sooner gone out than they talked of him in all the country round.
</p>

<h4>Cure of a dumb demoniac (9:32–34)</h4>

<p>
And it chanced that, as they were going, a dumb man was brought to him, possessed with a devil. 
The devil was cast out, and the dumb man found speech; at which the multitudes were filled with amazement; “Nothing like this”, they said, “was ever seen in Israel”. 
</p>

<p>
But the Pharisees said, “It is the prince of the devils that enables him to cast the devils out”.
</p>

<h4>The distress of the crowds (9:35–37)</h4>

<p>
So Jesus went about all their cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and infirmity.
</p>

<p>
Yet still, when he looked at the multitudes, he was moved with pity for them, seeing them harried and abject, like sheep that have no shepherd. 
Thereupon he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful enough, but the labourers are few; 
you must ask the Lord to whom the harvest belongs to send labourers out for the harvesting”.
</p>

<h3>B. The Instruction of the Apostles</h3>

<h4>The mission of the Twelve (10:1–16)</h4>

<p>
So he called his twelve disciples to him, and gave them authority to cast out unclean spirits, and to heal every kind of disease and infirmity. 
</p>

<p>
These are the names of the twelve apostles; first, Simon, also called Peter, then his brother Andrew, 
James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the publican, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, 
Simon the Cananean, and Judas Iscariot, the traitor. 
These twelve Jesus sent out; but first gave them their instructions; 
</p>

<p>
“Do not go”, he said, “into the walks of the Gentiles, or enter any city of Samaria; 
go rather to the lost sheep that belong to the house of Israel. 
And preach as you go, telling them, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand’. 
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out devils: give as you have received the gift, without payment. 
Do not provide gold or silver or copper to fill your purses, 
nor a wallet for the journey, no second coat, no spare shoes or staff; the labourer has a right to his maintenance. 
</p>

<p>
“Whenever you enter a city or a village, find out who is worthy to be your host, and make your lodging there until you go away. 
When you enter this house, you are to wish it well; 
and so, if the house is worthy, your good wishes shall come down upon it; if unworthy, let them come back to you the way they went. 
And wherever they will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that city or that house; 
I promise you, it shall go less hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrha at the day of judgement, than with that city.
Remember, I am sending you out to be like sheep among wolves; you must be wary, then, as serpents, and yet innocent as doves.
</p>

<h4>The missionaries will be persecuted (10:17–25)</h4>

<p>
“Do not put your trust in men; they will hand you over to courts of judgement, and scourge you in their synagogues; 
yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings on my account, so that you can bear witness before them, and before the Gentiles. 
Only, when they hand you over thus, do not consider anxiously what you are to say or how you are to say it; words will be given you when the time comes; 
it is not you who speak, it is the Spirit of your Father that speaks in you. 
</p>

<p>
“Brothers will be given up to execution by their brothers, and children by their fathers; children will rise up against their parents and will compass their deaths, 
and you will be hated by all men because you bear my name; that man will be saved, who endures to the last. 
Only, if they persecute you in one city, take refuge in another; I promise you, the Son of Man will come, before your task with the cities of Israel is ended. 
</p>

<p>
“A disciple is no better than his master, a servant than his lord; 
enough that the disciple should fare like his master, the servant like his lord. If they have cried Beelzebub at the master of the house, they will do it much more readily to the men of his household.
</p>

<h4>Open and fearless speech (10:26–33)</h4>

<p>
“Do not, then, be afraid of them. What is veiled will all be revealed, what is hidden will all be known; 
what I have said to you under cover of darkness, you are to utter in the light of day; what has been whispered in your ears, you are to proclaim on the house-tops. 
</p>

<p>
“And there is no need to fear those who kill the body, but have no means of killing the soul; fear him more, who has the power to ruin body and soul in hell. 
Are not sparrows sold two for a penny? And yet it is impossible for one of them to fall to the ground without your heavenly Father’s will. 
And as for you, he takes every hair of your head into his reckoning. 
Do not be afraid, then; you count for more than a host of sparrows.
</p>

<p>
“And now, whoever acknowledges me before men, I too will acknowledge him before my Father who is in heaven; 
and whoever disowns me before men, before my Father in heaven I too will disown him.
</p>

<h4>Jesus, the cause of dissension (10:34–36)</h4>

<p>“Do not imagine that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have come to bring a sword, not peace. 
I have come to set a man at variance with his father, and the daughter with her mother, and the daughter-in-law with her mother-in-law; 
a man’s enemies will be the people of his own house.
</p>

<h4>Renouncing self to follow Jesus (10:37–39)</h4>

<p>
“He is not worthy of me, that loves father or mother more; he is not worthy of me, that loves son or daughter more; 
he is not worthy of me, that does not take up his cross and follow me. 
He who secures<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-30" id="noteref-30" epub:type="noteref">[30]</a> his own life will lose it; it is the man who loses his life for my sake that will secure it.
</p>

<h4>Conclusion (10:40–42)</h4>

<p>
“He who gives you welcome, gives me welcome too; and he who gives me welcome gives welcome to him that sent me. 
</p>

<p>
“He who gives a prophet the welcome due to a prophet shall receive the reward given to prophets; and he who gives a just man the welcome due to a just man shall receive the reward given to just men.
</p>

<p>
“And if a man gives so much as a draught of cold water to one of the least of these here, because he is a disciple of mine, I promise you, he shall not miss his reward”.✻
