If this genealogy is compared with that given by St Luke (<a href="luke.xhtml#lk-3-23">3:23 and following</a>), it is clear that one at least of the two Evangelists must have reckoned descent by adoption as sufficient to make our Lord the legal inheritor of Abraham’s blessing and of David’s Kingdom. 
It is therefore not surprising that both have traced his ancestry through his foster-father. 
It is a common opinion, derived from the Fathers, that St Joseph and the Blessed Virgin were closely related. <a href="matthew.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink"> ↩ </a>

<a href="isaias.xhtml#is-7-10">Isaias 7:14</a>. ‘The virgin’ is a literal translation of the Hebrew; ‘a virgin’ would equally express the sense of the original prophecy. <a href="matthew.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink"> ↩ </a>

The text here is more literally rendered ‘he knew her not until she bore a son’; but the Hebrew word represented by ‘until’ does not imply that the event which might have been expected did take place afterwards (Confer <a href="genesis.xhtml#gn-8">Genesis 8:7</a>, <a href="palms.xhtml#ps-109">Psalms 109:2</a>, <a href="daniel.xhtml#dn-6-16">Daniel 6:24</a>, <a href="i-machabees#i-m-5-21">I Machabees 5:54</a>.). 
So that this phrase does not impugn the perpetual virginity of our Lady. 
Nor is any such inference to be drawn when our Lord is called her ‘first-born’ Son, which refers to his position as redeemable under the old law (<a href="luke.xhtml#lk-2-22">Luke 2:23</a>). <a href="matthew.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink"> ↩ </a>

No such prophecy has survived to us. 
But an obscure village is often regarded by its more important neighbours as typical of an unfashionable or provincial outlook; confer <a href="john.xhtml#jn-1-35">John 1:46</a>. 
The prophecy (<a href="isaias.xhtml#is-52-13">Isaias 53:3</a>) that our Lord would be despised by men was fulfilled when his contemporaries spoke of him scornfully as “a prophet from Nazareth” (like our ‘wise men of Gotham’). 
Some think the word should be, not Nazarene, but Nazirite; confer <a href="genesis.xhtml#gn-49">Genesis 49:26</a>. <a href="matthew.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink"> ↩ </a>
