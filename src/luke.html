<p>Once, when he had found a place to pray in, one of his disciples said to him, after his prayer was over, “Lord, teach us how to pray, as John did for his disciples”.
</p>

<p>
And he told them, “When you pray, you are to say, 
</p>

<blockquote>
Father, hallowed be your name; <br />
your kingdom come; <br />
give us this day our daily bread; <br />
and forgive us our sins; <br />
we too forgive all those who trespass against us; <br />
and lead us not into temptation”.
</blockquote>
